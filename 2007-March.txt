Subject: [spe-mac] Poll: native notebook or current custom notebook (please
	vote!)
Message-ID: <2078a7ad0703040731p4955902cjf0d6816d0cd0c4d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all spe mac users!

I am working on the next version of SPE, for wich Jurjen has made
several nice patches for the mac. I was wondering if anyone has
problems with the custom notebook control that is used in SPE for the
tabs with the different files. I discovered that Ubuntu/linux they are
not working properly, so for linux I decided to fall back on the
native notebook control, which unfortunately misses the following
features:
- no close button
- no drag & drop
- no tooltip

Please answer these two questions:

- Did you experience any issues with the file tabs?

- Do you prefer to use native tabs instead of the current
implementation (and loosing the features described above)?

Even if you are not very active here or you have little time, just
answer with yes or no. That's fine.

Thanks for answering!

Stani

Hi all,
I am pleased to announce that Jurjen and Andrea will start working on
an application bundle of SPE with py2app. It is still in the very
beginning, so no deadline set yet. However if some of you have
experience with bundling or py2app, please give a helping hand. You'll
make a lot of Mac user happy.
I forward the messages of Jurjen and Andrea, as I want that the
discussion is here so you can give feedback during the process.
Hopefully we can create a nice script, so that afterwards the
application bundle can be built automatically.
Thanks,
Stani

Cool!

Now we have a Mac release team! I hope you both efforts succeed. A lot
of people ask for a Spe package. Before someone has packaged SPE, but
that's long ago. I can send you his latest files. If I find them.

Does py2app comes with a small example? Anyway I have been working
hard on a new way of building the spe setup.py and package. Before my
way of packaging was not 100% correct, but I doubt if that is part of
the problem. You should maybe first try to use py2app for a smaller
demo.

I assume you've seen the documentation at
http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/doc/index.html ?  It
includes a number of examples which I found quite useful.

My main problem with py2app-bundled applications (and I should
emphasize that I've just started to play with these and am as far from
being an expert as you can get) is the size -- a small script ends up
as a 37MB app, because all the frameworks are bundled up.  There's a
"semistandalone" option that is supposed to take advantage of the
preexisting python frameworks on a standard Max install, but in my
first couple runs I didn't get that to work (my fault, I'm sure) and
it still didn't reduce the size as much as I'd hoped.

I'd love to see SPE as a Mac app bundle.  I haven't used most of  the
recent versions of SPE because, as they are, they're just a bit to
annoying to use.

Subject: [spe-mac] Please test SPE 0.8.4 from subversion (new release soon)
Message-ID: <2078a7ad0703060505u2c22afd9xaee089b0b98f521f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've been working a lot on fixing SPE and upgrading it with the latest
plugins. The winpdb debugger no longer fails and wxGlade crashes are
history. Is that not great? Are you eager to try it out yourself?
Please do! Get it from subversion and test it for any critical bug, so
I can iron it out. I have been patching a lot for Ubuntu users, who
will be very pleased with this release, and I'd like to thank Jurjen a
lot for his work on Mac issues. This is a definitely a release
everyone should upgrade to, wether you use windows, mac or linux!

Here is an overview what has been done:

The focus in this release is bugfixing, plugin upgrades and
compatibility with wxPython 2.8, but it still works on wxPython 2.6

Upgrades:
- WinPdb to 1.0.8 (not fail in timely manner anymore)
- wxGlade to latest cvs (support for wxWindows2.8)

New features:
- Save as copy
- Clear output pane

Read more and comment at http://pythonide.stani.be

PS. Winpdb does not work well on Mac & wxpython2.8 Nir is working on
an update. So when it comes out it will be included with SPE.

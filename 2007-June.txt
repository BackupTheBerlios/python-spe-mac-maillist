Subject: [spe-mac] unittest.main() throws AttributeError
Message-ID: <46804BB4.8070105@mit.edu>

I'm pretty new to both OS X and SPE, so please forgive me if this is a 
stupid question or if I'm missing any information.

I just installed SPE on my macbook using the SVN repositories, and I'm 
running into a really weird problem. When I run unittest.main() from a 
script, I get:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    File 
"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4//lib/python2.4/unittest.py", 
line 532, in loadTestsFromName
    parent, obj = obj, getattr(obj, part)
    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute ''

The attribute at the end seems to be an empty string. If I comment out 
unittest.main() from my script, everything run s fine.

The weird thing is: if I execute my script from a terminal, everything 
runs fine.

BTW, I'm running Python 2.4.4 (from MacPython binary), OS X 10.4.9, and 
the latest SPE from SVN.

Thanks in advance,
-Tony

What happens if you run it through the debugger? Ctrl+F9 or Alt+F9

Thanks for your reply! Unfortunately, I'm even more confused now:

My script runs through the debugger without a hitch!

After comparing the debugger run to the traceback I get back from SPE, I 
noticed that the debugger doesn't reach half of the methods in the 
traceback (attached).  When the debugger gets to the parseArgs() method 
(see traceback) of unittest, a conditional statement recognizes that 
unittest.main() has been called without arguments and returns to the 
__init__ method of unittest.main(); thus, the createTests() method (see 
traceback), which appears later in the parseArgs() method, is never 
executed when I run debugger.

Any ideas? Thanks,
-Tony

Please try out the new winpdb
(http://www.digitalpeers.com/pythondebugger/), which will be in SPE
soon. If the issue still exists there, contact Nir Aides through the
winpdb forums about this.

So it turns out that I don't know how to use winpdb. Python **does** 
raise an exception when I run unittest.main() with winpdb, I just didn't 
realize this when I stepped through the program. To add confusion to the 
mix, the exception occurs in a different function (the runTests method 
called from __init__ of unittest) and it raises a SystemExit exception 
instead of AttributeError (which was raised in spe). This happens to me 
in both versions of winpdb (1.1.0 from spe and 1.1.4 from the website 
below). Just to reiterate, I don't get either of these errors when I run 
my script from the terminal.

In any case, I don't think I'll have time to fiddle with this anymore. 
I'll just wait until I install Ubuntu on my macbook before I try running 
SPE.

Thanks anyway,
-Tony

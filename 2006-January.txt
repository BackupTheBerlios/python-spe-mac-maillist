Hello Stani et al! A happy new year!

I just found out: If I launch SPE from the shell with a script name  
('spe myprog.py'), SPE opens the right file, but if I try to save, it  
can't remember the path, i.e. acts always like 'Save As'.

Subject: [spe-mac] Editor window font anti-aliasing
Message-ID: <97670e910601120558l6e6e5d36kbca921647f661945@mail.gmail.com>

Is is possible to turn off the anti-aliasing of the font in the main editor
window? I would love to use the ProggyClean (
http://www.proggyfonts.com/index.php?menu=download ) monospaced bitmap font
for editing, but it only looks good at a font size of 16 without
anti-aliasing (at least in OS X).

On the Mac (running OS X) one can turn of anti-aliasing for the font in the
standard Terminal.app window, so it should be possible to do this on an
application by application basis, without having to change the global
anti-aliasing settings.

Hi Rudolph,
Mac users asked for anti-aliasing, but if you want to turn it off,
feel free to hack into _spe/smwxp/stc.py and look for the lines
(around 435):

    def SetStyles(self):
        self.StyleClearAll()

        # anti-aliasing
        if hasattr(self,'SetUseAntiAliasing'):
            self.SetUseAntiAliasing(True)     #---> REPLACE THIS WITH False

Message-ID: <2078a7ad0601142135v3436f442i95516bce517c6c35@mail.gmail.com>

SPE 0.8.1.d [Release]<http://www.stani.be/python/spe/blog/categorylist_html?cat_id=1>


 SPE gets rid of terminal windows when executing scripts. The output is
shown nicely formatted with colors and hyperlinks to jump to the source
code. Files can be run as such with or without dialog box to pass arguments.
For those who prefer 'running scripts externally in terminals' is still
available.

(See http://pythonide.stani.be/manual/html/manual4_html_5029fe9c.gif)

.

On MacOS X and Linux SPE can now show files simultaneously as columns or
rows for comparitive editing. You can select which files are shown, by Ctrl
clicking them.

(See http://pythonide.stani.be/manual/html/manual4_html_1cde0f5.jpg)

.

SPE was for the first time tested on and improved for Ubuntu (and hopefully
so for Linux in general). I adapted SPE such that it can ran out of the box
of an archive (zip or tar.gz). This has the advantage that Linux (but also
Mac and Windows) don't have to install SPE anymore but can just run it out
of a folder or USB stick, provided the right version of wxPython (2.6) is
installed on the system as it is always the case with Ubuntu boxes. If you
want to install SPE in this way, use the -no_setup.zip distribution, but
don't forget to uninstall your previous version of SPE first.
  *New features*:

   - new run system with redirected output
   - column and row view modes
   - SPE can run just from a folder (provided wxPython 2.6 is present)

  *Improved features*:

   - file tabs (by Andrea Gavana)
   - warning before executing whole file
   - various improvements for Ubuntu/GTK
   - 'find in files' in multiple paths when separated by ';' (Nick Trout)
   - browser file order by relative path instead of base (Nick Trout)

  *Fixes*:

   - global todo fix (by Benjamin Hess)
   - realtime id fix
   - utf8 encoding recognition
   - Windows 98 run fix (by Fuzzyman)
   - fix for execute in shell (except,else,elif)
   - passing arguments to running files (by Karl-Heinz Glahe)

  *Manual*:

   - Quick install without setup (Windows, Linux and MacOS X)
   - Running files
   - FAQ updated with what if SPE doesn't start up
   - FAQ updated with 'Advertisements on website'

I just checked the archive and it is all there. There should be no problem.

Hi,
I tested the browser to include it again. It seems to work. Upgrading
to wxPython 2.6.2 is extremely easy for Macintosh users (there is an
uninstall script). So should I check if the right version is installed
or can I just assume everybody upgrades?

I have been waiting 'til we had a good version before mentioning this, and I
think it's a good time now. 

I think there are two items here.

1)	I've noticed that the scrolling in SPE was slow on my TiBook - to the point
that it feels a little sluggish. I just tried 0.8.1.d on my Windows laptop
(similar speed) and it was pretty snappy. 

2)	The newest SPE (SVN 149) had very peculiar window updating on my Mac (I
didn't try it on the Windows box). The various panes would open very large, then
shrink to their proper size each time a new file opened. Here's what I saw:

-	On initial launch, the python terminal session openedin the full window; then
shrunk down to the bottom third as normal.

-	There's an error "Error opening workspace file : No section: 'openfiles'"
displayed there.

-	Opening a source file showed the entire source file filling the top pane (left
to right edges), then the split bar dividing the top pane, then a section of a
file hierarchy in the left pane (don't know what that was) then finally the
normal list of functions, etc. in the left pane. I managed to catch a screen
shot - attached.

-	Finally the window fixes itself, and works properly. 

I'm using an 867MHz G4 TiBook, 10.4.4, with 1 GByte of RAM. I'm using
ActivePython 2.4.2, and using wxPython 2.6.2.1.

Rudolph can you confirm if the "window updating" is the one Richard
describes below or do you have other issues? If you work with large files,
it is better to set "check realtime with" to none in Preferences>Editor if
typing would get slow.

Can you check if this is a wxPython issue, by copying&pasting the same file
in the wxPython demo and see if it behaves the same. I wouldn't know what
would cause it too be slow. I'm afraid it is a wxMac issue.

I guess snappy is the opposite of sluggish? It might prove it is a wxMac
issue. Stefan, any thoughts about this?

The main window is a splitterwindow, it normally only updates its size at an
on Idle event. I forced it using the UpdateSize method and it seems to be
fixed now. (I'll update soon to the SVN.)

-       There's an error "Error opening workspace file : No section:
> 'openfiles'"
> displayed there.


Fixed, now only displayed in statusbar if SPE is in debugging mode.

The browser is back in town! It is the last tab of the sidebar. I strongly
recommend everyone to read the new SPE tutorial of Dimitri:
http://www.serpia.org/spe The browser is explained there.

Anyway, the browser before (wxPython 2.6.1 ) was buggy and was left out.

I'm not seeing the same behaviour as Richard, but I'm not running the
latest svn version of SPE. I'm using the latest release v0.8.1.d.

I'm seeing sluggish scrolling even on small files.

Except for the dreaded "LCD horizontal lines issue"  (
http://15inpbscreen.appleplace.com/ ) it is a great machine.

I tried this and the sluggishness is not present, i.e., the slow
update and scroll behaviour is only present in SPE. I also made sure
to turn off realtime syntax checking in SPE.

Snappy is good. I don't think it is a wxMac issue though. I looked at
another wxPython based IDE called DrPython (I think it also uses
Scintilla) and it did not exhibit the sluggishness.

You can now download SPE 0.8.2.a!

I'm seeing sluggish scrolling even on small files.


Small file for me is <1000 lines.

OK, I'll try to find it. I can't promise anything as these things are
sometimes quite hidden. What you mean with update? Keyboard typing? Can you
also set update sidebar as 'when clicked' preferences>editor to see if that
has effect on it?

Same with me.

Here even the wx demo is sluggish, e.g. if I type a dot in PyCrust it  
needs years (ok, about 10-20 secs) to show the list of objects, same  
in SPE, naturally.
The stc demo has no problems.
I guessed it's a problem of wxMac or my slow old machine (G4/400 but  
with 1.75 GB RAM and latest updates of everything).
But it may be more a problem of checking every keystroke etc. (SPE  
does a lot more with stc than the demo).

Sorry, I've no time for investigations at the moment, only wanted to  
give feedback.

Greetlings from Lake Constance!

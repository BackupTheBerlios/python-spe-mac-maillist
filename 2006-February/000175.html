<PRE>First I would like to say thank you for the editor, it is very nice :)
Each version just gets better than the last!

There are however still a few bugs I hope this can helps to find them.
I am not good at gui programing myself.

1) When run in multiple document windows/pallet mode (mac style) there
is a few problems

a) Can't load image file from
'/Apps/_spe/defaults/skins\default\import.png': file does not exist.
I assume this is because some slashes are going the wrong way.

b)Next window previous window icons on the floating pallet do not
appear to do anything.

c) The main window (not document window) with the toolbar icons is to
tall and when it try to shrink it it can't shrink far enough and
remains way to tall. The smallest it will go is about 2 inches tall
and it should go to 1/2 an inch tall.

d)It does not remember the size or locations of windows.

2) Calltips, this is when you type the . and a menu pops up, yes? When
I try to turn this off the little menu still pops up, But this time in
 a different font. Also it would be nice to  be able to turn this off
for numbers, it is annoying to have it pop up with all the attributes
of the int class whenever I try to type in a floating decimal.

3) In the shell when the text is hi-lighted and then you click on it
it will crash. I know this is a problem with wxpython but you put a
work around in for the document window, that would be nice in the
shell also.

I have a ibook g4 with OS X 10.4.3, python 2.3.5, wxpython 2.5.3.1, SPE 0.8.2.a

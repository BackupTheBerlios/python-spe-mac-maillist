Hi,
I created this list in order to speed up the debugging
process for SPE on the Mac. I hope we can help each
other. I would like to have a priority list for Mac.
Currently for me it is:
1. preferences dialog box doesn't work
2. switching between documents is not Mac like (cmd >
or so)
3. notebook display

I want to commit myself to make this release as stable
as possible for the mac on the condition i have your
support. (Although I can't wait to implement some new
features.)

Let the discussion be opened! 
Stani


PS If you want to unsubscribe...
With everyone of you I had contact about SPE on Mac
recently or in the past. If you don't want to be
subscribed to this list, please unsubscribe silently.
If you don't know how to do it, send me an email
(s_t_a_n_i at yahoo.com), and I'll do it for you.

Well, I will code the solutions for the list I
proposed. I would like SPE to be as comfortable as
possible for mac users. So it is not only about bugs,
but also about design and navigation... 

Everytime I post a new release with enhancements for
the mac, I would like that a lot of you would test it
and report if things are fixed. So please test the
latest version (at least 0.7.4.o) and see if opening
files still gives a segmentation fault. If it does,
could someone put print statements to localize what
exactly causes this error.

Once SPE is acceptably stable, I also would like if
some of you put an effort in pushing it into the OS X
distributions. 

What would be completely great if someone has
connections with Apple that they sponsor this project
with a mac with osX, so I could do the debugging
myself as well. Now it is hard to develop a mac app on
windows. Maybe a joint request would help.

I'll try to get it setup tonight. There are three ways to distribute open
source software on the Mac that I know of: Fink, DarwinPorts, and a Mac
installer package. The Mac installer package is probably the easiest of the
bunch, but DarwinPorts has the most software.

I'll see if DarwinPorts is up to date on wxWindows tonight.

As a Mac user (and a technical one), I'd really appreciate a Mac  
installer, rather
than a darwinports installer. darwinports is much better than fink,  
but even so,
I won't use it unless it is absolutely critical that I install a  
piece of software--things
just go wrong too often.

What would be absolutely the best is simply a standalone Mac  
application,
distributed as a compressed archive. Unless there really is some  
configuration
that must be done at install time, this offers the ultimate in  
simplicity.

Thanks to both Brian and Stani for their work.

How it should distribruted is something which is completely up to you. 
Of course it would be nice if some of you volunteer as packagers. At the 
moment I'm releasing almost daily just zipping the files in order to not 
to waste too much time for it. From the moment SPE is stable, I'd love 
to see a SPE installer for the Mac.
Please overwrite the file '_spe/dialogs/preferencesDialog.py' with this 
one. It has print statements to see which control causes the error.
 >>> python spe.py --debug >debug.txt
Please send me the error log (debug.txt).
Ciao,

This the old mac spe package (0.7.3.a) of Kevin Walzer, who discontinued 
offering python support. It might be of some use for those who want to 
package:
http://www.stani.be/python/spe/releases/0.7/SPE-OSX.zip
I want to distribute the mac package through the berlios site, but at 
the moment debugging is for me more important than packaging.

Trying:

     python _spe/SPE.py

in

     .../SPE-0.7.4.o-wx26

gives me:

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "_spe/SPE.py", line 1, in ?
     import info
   File "/Users/ken/downloads/SPE-0.7.4.o-wx26/_spe/info.py", line 1,  
in ?
     import os,sys,sm.osx
ImportError: No module named sm.osx


and indeed, I can't find a folder or file called sm or sm.py in _spe.

If I try

     python SPE.py

within the _spe directory, I get the same error.

Note that by default, "." is on the python path so (if my  
understanding of the SPE
install instructions is correct), one of these should have been the  
'correct' directory
so that modules needed by SPE could be seen by python.


Thanks,

Ok, installation at the moment is a bit spartanic. Just copy _spe and sm 
to your python/lib/site-packages dir after you deleted previous versions 
of them if they would be there. When SPE is stable an installation 
wizard will be provided.

for python package ,maybe you can use "py2app" to create a mac installer.

Hi,
I need your feedback! From now on if I put 'test:' in the subject it 
means this post contains test files. It would be nice if some would test 
this as fast as possible.

1. Please, can someone test this file independently of SPE, just on its own:
 >>> python smdi2.py

Make some new children (File>New) and try to navigate between them with 
standard Mac commands (cmd~,cmd>,cmd<, am I right?). If this works I 
might implement it for SPE. Note that is not possible to close the 
parent window.

2. Preferences: can someone send me the error log with 0.7.4.o when 
trying to open the preferences? I'm waiting for this to fix the 
preferences bug on OS X

Thanks,
Stani

cmd` cycles one way through the open Windows, cmd~ cycles through the other way, so that is working.

cmd<left arrow> and cmd<right arrow>  move to the beginning & end of line as expected. (cmd< and cmd> didn't do anything in any app I tried.)

FWIW, a page that lists XP vs X shortcuts: http://www.xvsxp.com/keyboard/ (no idea on accuracy, though)

Also, is it as designed, or are the child windows not visually "children" of the parent window? I have these free-floating text edit boxes and the one "parent" window with the toolbar buttons.... (similar in SPE -- a different window for each file (although each window contains all the toolbar controls.) In the SPE.PDF, I didn't see screenshots of multiple Windows on Windows, so I was wondering what is expected....

Thanks for the work (and BTW, I can now save files.)

Someone of us will have to do this, you can use py2app only on a Mac.

New and Close are bound to <n> and <w> instead of <Cmd-n> and <Cmd- 
w>, that makes testing really hard.
smdi segfaults if I run it from SPE.
I don't know if there are any standard Mac keys for navigating  
between windows or tabs, nothing worked what I tried. Navigation  
within the line is good.

Let's try if the logs make it through...

That's the latest he sended to me. You can take that as a starting point 
by removing its _spe and sm folders and replacing it with the new one. 
Make sure no old source files from these folders remain. I'm about to 
release a new version of SPE, with an improved framework for the Mac I 
hope. It's all gambling in the dark. Please test that version 0.7.4.r 
thoroughly. Can someone say very quickly if preferences work in the 
latest version and if not send the error log? I don't think for now it 
makes sense to start packaging, at least the preferences should work.But 
maybe that's already the case.  Also I'm releasing more than daily, so 
probably it would get easily behind.

1. This interface of this release should be better than before:
- cycling through windows in standard Mac way (cmd` cycles one way 
through the open Windows, cmd~ cycles through the other way)
- hiding of the shell is possible
Let me know if this works

2 Nobody gave feedback if preferences are now working

3 Also are keyboard shortcuts working?

4 Try the browser in the sidebar and check if the printed path is valid.

Please try this version out asap.

A couple of quick comment (gotta run to dinner....):

.7.4.r, OS X 10.3.9, wxPython 2.6.1, Python 2.4.1

 1) cmd-N creates new

 2) cmd-` writes ` into the text window instead of going to a new Window (looks like cmd not being hooked at all inside the text editor (except for system commands, such as cmd-tab.)

 3) The opened child windows no longer have the toolbar buttons on them.

 4) 'Preferences' don't come up. Traceback (most recent call last):

Please don't only give the error log also the stdout where the print 
statements go. Is Mdi giving this error log? Is for a wx.Combobox the 
method GetValue not working? Could please someone test that in a

Can't change the MDI default, and the way it runs seems part SDI, part MDI...

FWIW, the wxPython demo has a wx.ComboBox demo, which seems to return the correct value (although doesn't use GetValue), BUT I can get the wxPython Demo to crash pretty quickly on my system using this sample (I haven't played around with much else -- maybe someone with more wxPython experience on Mac knows more?)

Hi

I don't know whether this is a problem just for me (Running on Tiger
10.4.2, Python 2.4.1, latest wxPython release build for Python 2.4.1) :

- as of now, the About... Menu item in the Application menu is not wired
against the 'about' menu item of SPE (And the About menu item persists
in the Help menu)
- the Preferences Menu Item persists in the Edit Menu and the one in the
Application menu is grayed out

If in _spe/Menu.py , I move the #Mac Tweaks source lines from the def
__events__ in line 201 up to the __init__ in line 148, then these things
are wired correctly

HTH

Stefan

The problem with the preferences dialog is the following :

The mdi combobox gets set to 0 in __set_properties (called from __init__
line 89 , but receives its range of values only afterwards (line 96 in
__init__ ), therefore the OS remains at -1 for the selection, as at that
time a selection of 0 would be invalid.

Suggested fix : moving the key adding in front of the __set_properties
call

Best,

Stefan

Hey, that's what the preferences dialog looks like.... ;-) (aka, after I made the below change, I could see the prefernces dialog.)

Thanks.

Of course, I then change the preferences to use 'single with tabs (mac), and SPE doesn't startup with that option:

STDERR / STDOUT (BTW, any way to include python version in the platform & wxPython version info:

SPE v0.7.4.r (c)2003-2005 www.stani.be

If spe fails to start:
 - type "python SPE.py --debug > debug.txt" at the command prompt
 - send debug.txt with some info to s_t_a_n_i at yahoo.com

Blender support disabled (run SPE inside Blender to enable).
Spe is running in debugging mode.
Configuration:
- platform  : darwin
- wxPython  : 2.6.1.0.
- interface : single with tabs (mac)
- encoding  : mac-roman

This interface is not implemented yet, so I commented it out. Good you 
mention it. BTW this how I like to see error reports. You can still 
choose the old interface for mac 'single with tabs (mac, linux, 
windows)', but I wouldn't recommend it unless you are really tab 
addicted (tabs are un-mac if I understood well from mac users feedback). 
Now I'm developping the new one 'single with palette (mac default)', 
which is now the default for mac. Instead of a toolbar, there will be a 
tool palette (Photoshop like) to make it look more like a real, native 
mac app. This will be released in the 's' version. Of course I'm very 
curious if this works and I hope Mac users will be happy with that. I 
announce the release on this list.

Hi,
I'm curious if the tool palette works. I added a screenshot so you know 
how it should look like. I still have to implement the Ctrl+` 
shortchuts, but you can cycle through the windows with the arrows on the 
tool palette. Can someone send me (not to the list) a screenshot of spe 
with toolbar and preferences dialog? That would be nice.

>> >Which change?

I'm at work and don't have access to the email, but someone (stephen?) mentioned making a change to the preferencesDialog.py file -- moving the adding of key values to the ComboBox a few lines up to put it before the values are referenced.

And there was a different email with a change to the Menu.py file to put come Mac specific code in the __init__ method as opposed to where it was.... Allowed access of 'Preferences' from under the application menu.

>> BTW this how I like to see error reports.

FYI, for folks on UNIXes, you might want to change your debug instructions from "python SPE.py --debug > debug.txt" to "python SPE.py --debug > debug.txt 2>&1" 

Without that '2>&1', items written to STDOUT go to the file debug.txt, and items written to STDERR (the stack trace) goes to the console, which is why you might be getting disjoint info.

Might be the same on Windows (I know '2>&1' works on windows in a command prompt, but can't test directly with SPE, as not an approved software package for use at work....)

Hi
 
- about and prefs menu items are wired correctly
 
- the preferences dialog still has the same problem, I've described the
reason for the crash and the workaround in the previous mail, in your
new code, please put the call for self.__fill in front of the
self.__set_properties

Hi Stefan,
Will this work as well in __fill (source file attached)? I thought this 
could be more clean.
    def __fill(self):
        #mdi
        keys = smdi.DI.keys()
        keys.remove('<default>')
        keys.sort()
        for key in keys:
            self.Mdi.Append(key)

You can test it by overwriting _spe/dialogs/preferencesDialog.py

Only oddity I saw upon a few-minute inspection was that the application 
crashes ungracefully with a "Bus error" if the last open source window 
is closed.

Something seems funky with the close behavior of the source windows - 
if I close with them all with red button on each window, I get an error 
(most recent time I tried, it was a Segmentation fault), but closing 
with command-W does not seem to produce this behavior.

Can I suggest others try it and report their results?

Had a blackout + real life intrude on testing time.... ;-)

Using 0.7.4.x, quick hits:

A PDF of a screenshot at http://homepage.mac.com/kkrull/FileSharing6.html :

 1) There are two 'Windows' menu items -- I assume that there should only be one.

 2) On startup, I have 'Unnamed' & 'Unnamed -- SPE 0.7.4.x' windows (see the SPE_windows_OS X.pdf file at the above URL.) If I set my preference to 'Single with tabs (Mac, Windows, Linux), when I open a second file, an additional window is opened, so I have three (untitled, untitled, SPE 0.7.4.x.) Single_with_tabs_not_single.pdf at above URL.

    2.1) when I create new files, they all have the same name.

    2.2) As far as tabs being an OS X thing, I'm not a Mac head by any stretch of the imagination, and I like tab. Safari uses them... Other editors have them -- maybe time for a poll.... ;-)

 3) On menu, second from left, says 'Python' instead of 'SPE' (although I believe that this can only be set as part of an OS X APP package, but in case another way...

 4) When a dialog is launched from the Palette, it is partially hidden behind the Palette. Also the preferences Palette. (spe_pref_part_hidden.pdf at the above location -- build in screen capture utility only goes to PDF, and don't have another utility setup right now.)

 5) cmd` & cmd~ no longer write to the edit window, but also don't cycle through the windows. cmd (left arrow) doesn't go to the beginning of the line, cmd <right arrow> to the end of the line.

 6) On install, I delete the ~/.spe directory, the /site-packages _spe & sm directories, yet when I do a File | Open in SPE, it remembers my last location. Handy, but shouldn't this pref be reset when I do the above?

 7) Under Links | Enthought... (http://www.enthought.com/python/) The main listed distro has a wxPython version too old for this version of SPE -- if the beta version linked at the bottom doesn't have a compatible wxPython, might want to remove the link....

 8) Help | Keyboard Shortcuts are Windows shortcuts....

 9) Minor Feature Request: would be nice to have an 'Open Recent' option on the File menu that remembers the last x (10?) files that you've opened.

10) In the UML view, if you have methods that have long names and/or many parameter, the class is much wider than the screen and the horizontal scrollbar doesn't scale correctly. (spe_uml.pdf) (Please, no comments on my code/design -- just playing around with my first Python app and tried to find something 'fun'.)

11) Pressing F1 doesn't bring up local help tips (as mentioned in the status bar at the bottom of SPE.)

12) When I have a file open (source code view), I need to double-click on a class/method in the Explorer view to jump to it -- as designed? (or should it be single click?)

13) When running from inside SPE, the scriptname isn't set.

Create the following in a new file. Save it.:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print "hello"

Run it:
Running '<path/filename>' ...
hello
Script '<source>' returned exit code 0

I assume that the above '<source>' should be the filename

14) If one creates a new file, doesn't save it, and tries to run it, if you say 'no' to save, the previously run file is run, not the selected new file. (not a recommended thing to do, of course, but....)

15) When my indenting was off by a character,  the error message was off by one line (running from the command line returned the correct line number (see message below -- it says 116, when run in command line, it is 115. (and not sure why it mentioned the 'scriptutils.py' file. (sorry if this is a PyCrust thing...)    

 Running '/Users/kkrull/work/learning/python/NWN/nwnCharacterCombatInfo.py' ...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/site-packages/sm/scriptutils.py", line 40, in run
    codeObject = compile(source.replace('\r\n','\n')+"\n", fileName, "exec")
IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level (<source>, line 116)
Exception raised while running script  <source>

 16) ctrl-c copies text in the SPE python shell, cmd-c expected on Mac (PyCrust run standalone recognizes cmd-c)

 17) In the python shell, one can type anywhere, new output from a run it put wherever the cursor is located. As expected? (when doing this, can delete/overwrite items, and undo doesn't undo changes.) Other shells (PyCrust stand alone) only allow text to be added on the last line. 


Sorry, I know I should do seperate bug reports, but time....

Hello All,

The SVN repository for SPE is now on line. You can grab the latest code
using the following command.

svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/python/spe/trunk/

You can all so checkout the releases with this command:
svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/python/spe/branches/SPE-x.x.x

(Where the x's are the version)
Currently there aren't any releases yet and the trunk is 7.4.x.

Finally, you may browse and download parts of the source with the web
interface in the SVN section of this site.

Thanks,
Sam Widmer

Of course, please make an error report and put it on the bug tracker. It 
doesn't happen on windows.

PS Please make the subject of postings more specific, instead of just

Hi,

Haha, everybody wants something different. I indeed would like to poll 
tabs in these group. The option with no tabs will always be available, 
but with tabs will take me some more effort of which I want to save 
myself if nobody is waiting for it.

That also struck me. If anybody knows how to change this, I'd be happy

This wxPy behaviour. I could hide the tools Palette when a dialog is

> 7) Under Links | Enthought... (http://www.enthought.com/python/) The main listed distro has a wxPython version too old for this version of SPE -- if the beta version linked at the bottom doesn't have a compatible wxPython, might want to remove the link....

I know they are upgrading to wxPy2.6, but face some difficulties. I even 
could contact them to include SPE in their distro.

Right, low priority. Maybe one of you could fix this. Shouldn't be 
difficult. (in _spe/dialogs: helpShortcutsDialog.py and shortcuts.txt) 
Please keep it cross platform:
to check for mac:
if _spe.info.DARWIN:
    ...

> 9) Minor Feature Request: would be nice to have an 'Open Recent' option on the File menu that remembers the last x (10?) files that you've opened.

Yes, I'll implement that. Put it in feature requests...

>10) In the UML view, if you have methods that have long names and/or many parameter, the class is much wider than the screen and the horizontal scrollbar doesn't scale correctly. (spe_uml.pdf) (Please, no comments on my code/design -- just playing around with my first Python app and tried to find something 'fun'.)

Put it in the bug tracker. In next releases I have some plans with UML.

>11) Pressing F1 doesn't bring up local help tips (as mentioned in the status bar at the bottom of SPE.)

Put also in bug tracker.

>12) When I have a file open (source code view), I need to double-click on a class/method in the Explorer view to jump to it -- as designed? (or should it be single click?)

Double-click is design.

>14) If one creates a new file, doesn't save it, and tries to run it, if you say 'no' to save, the previously run file is run, not the selected new file. (not a recommended thing to do, of course, but....)

BT, although I just use pycrust, but will have a look anyway.

> 17) In the python shell, one can type anywhere, new output from a run it put wherever the cursor is located. As expected? (when doing this, can delete/overwrite items, and undo doesn't undo changes.) Other shells (PyCrust stand alone) only allow text to be added on the last line.

I hope you find now some time for it. Thanks anyway for this usefull 
feedback. I wish I could get more feedback like this.

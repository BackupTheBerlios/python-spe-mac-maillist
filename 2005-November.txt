Hi,
I started working on the Mac port. Trying to figure out which things
are SPE bugs or simply just wxMac bugs (like eg. the GenericDirCtrl is
crashing, also in wxPython demo).  I would like to discuss the
development of SPE on the spe-dev mailing list. But step by step we
are tackling things.
I remember getting very useful feedback from this list before and I
definitely need some of you as well on spe-dev. So please take a
moment and subscribe yourself. Actually I need more mac people on the
spe-dev list, otherwise it will slow down the whole proces
significantly and I have to cross-post as well here, which I want to
avoid.
Anyway, I'm still impressed by the financial support you gave to make
this all possible. I'll do my best too.
Thanks,
Stani

Well, ok, I guess I can't find the link to subscribe to spe-dev. Can  
you point me in the right direction?

Hi,
Good news! I came back from a week in Paris and my new mini mac has
finally arrived. So what I need to do know is to get wxPython2.6 on
it. What's the best way. Appearantly it is not wise to remove the
existing wxPython 2.5.3.1 which is on it.
Of course I have also some basic questions how to use python on the mac.
Is there any volunteer who could assist me through chat
(skype,messenger,ichat?). In that way I won't loose too much time with
it.
Thanks in advice!

Hi to all,

I've just worked my way into making spe work together with blender on 
Mac OSX.
I had a few difficulties starting it, and setting the Pythonpath didn't 
solved anything.
So I changed a few things in the blend file, to make it work.

Its just a quick hack, but should work for a standard Python 
installation on the Mac.

There was a problem with construction of the site-packages path.

Find attached a blend file which works fine for me.
If i find the time, i'll post a more elegant and flexible construction 
of the path to the site-packages.

best regards

kay

I might be not the best shot, because i'm also somehow a bit new to this 
environment, but if you lack other support, i might give some help with it:

r0str0t is my username on ichat (aim-account)

I'm online currently

so have a try ...

Hi Stani,

guess it won't, cause it's just setting the site-packages path for MacOS 
as a string, not as a os.path.join.
very dirty hacking.

I'm online as hraban at mac.com

I'd suggest to fetch ActivePython 2.4.2 and the latest wxPython -  
don't touch the system installed stuff! Simply put your Python before  
system's in your path.

Greetlings, Hraban

Thanks Kay!

If you can find the time, would it be possible for you to post a 
step-by-step description of what you did -- starting with a "plain 
vanilla" MacOS-X installation?

Hopefully, it is mostly a series of things of the form:

	"Follow the excellent directions at ... to install ... , except that 
at step ..., you need to do ..."

and ending with:

	"Have fun using your new SPE/Blender combination!"

ADVThanksANCE!

Paris, ah, I envy you.

If you're comfortable with makefiles, compilers, and all that,  
probably the best way would be to compile wxPython into a different  
folder. I've always been pissed off by the fact that Apple never felt  
it appropriate to put in a /usr/local structure, so I'd probably put  
in /usr/local/lib and link against it from there.

Once you have something working, _please_ distributes as a full,  
complete, statically linked binary. Memory is cheap, and there's  
really no reason why people should jump through the hoops Apple's non- 
standard directory structure imposes. (Actually, I think most things  
should be distributed in this form anyway.)

You're from Belgium? Where? My wife and I were just through  
Amsterdam, Bruges, Ypres, and Paris a couple of months ago. Except  
for the high cost of housing, man, I wish I lived in Europe. (Paris  
especially). So much to see, so much to do.

Good luck,
Ken

Hi Rick, Hi all,

the machine i'm working on has a standard MacOS (10.3.9) Python 2.3 
Framework installation, which is installed under: 
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/
and the sitepackages:
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/lib/python2.3/site-packages/
or
/Library/Python/2.3/

It may be that things are different under OSX 10.4 or when you have 
installed another Python distribution (not the apple package).

to install spe use:
 >python setup.py install

for wxpython 2.6 you can use the Mac installer.

Spe alone starts only with the pythonw command, not python. The whole 
command line is:
 >pythonw /Library/Python/2.3/_spe/SPE.py

this works fine with no further changes to the environment var's.

With blender, using blender 2.37a, Spe is not starting from the 
spe.blend file, even when you set the environment variable PYTHONPATH 
and start blender from a terminal.
It will complain about not finding wx.

So change the path construction in the spe.blend file, to point to the 
Mac Location of the site-packages. Or use my speMac.blend file which you 
can find attached to my first mail.

and like magic, spe starts from within blender.

oh, and not to forget:

"Have fun using your new SPE/Blender combination!"

please note that as I said earlier, my speMac.blend really is a fast 
hack, just setting the site-packages path with a string, lacking a path 
constructor, and switch for different os'es like win/mac/linux.
If I find the time, I'll give that a try within the next days.

comment:
It looks like, when the Mac-Python installation packaged by apple is 
used, the path layout is different from the standard python layout.

question:
Can anyone confirm that, who has made a python installation which is not 
packaged by apple? If so the path construction must be changed/switched 
accordingly to the kind of python installation used on the mac.

best regards

kay

That's good news. Now you may play with GenericDirCtrl on Mac  
yourself a little bit now. :-)
I'm online as my gmail account (czhang.cmu_AT_gmail.com) via iChat,

Looking forward to some advances on SPE/Mac front.
Thanks.

On 10.4 Apple's lib dir is
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/lib/python2.3/
and site-packages is at
/Library/Python/2.3/site-packages/

lib dir from my Python 2.4 (from Bob Ippolito's site) is at
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/
with site-packages below

In both installations, bin is at Versions/(Version)/bin
Instead of the version number you can also use "Current" (a symlink  
to the current version).

Thus, my $PATH contains /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/ 
Current/bin/

Dear all,

Unfortunately I became sick the day after my last post. I guess I took
Paris flu as a souvenir. I feel better and started working on SPE, on
which I'll report in another mail.

Let me answer your suggestions about my mac mini...

Unfortunately I'm not familiar with compiling. I hope to take a more
newbie approach.

I guess you mean py2app? That's the purpose on long run. First I want
to concentrate to get something working.

I'm from Belgium, but live in Amsterdam. So next time, ring my bell.

This approach pleases me, as for now I prefer not to touch the
installed system. I still have too much questions of how to just
handle a mac, so I refrain from fidling around. So Hraban, I guess
I'll bother you ;-)

Hi All,

As announced on the spe-dev mailing list, I worked hard on SPE's stability.

Thanks to Hrabans help, I was able to install easily ActivePython
2.4.2 and wxPython2.6 on the Mac. I was able to start the latest SPE
(subversion 70, to be released soon) without any problem. So if even I
as totally mac newbie can do it, you can do it as well ;-)

Now, I'd like to collect all basic (!) mac-specific issues (bugs &
features) centrally on a wiki. Please follow the instructions at:
http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=Stani%27s_Python_Tools

For me the characters were very small. Is that because of my screen resolution?

For those of you who have subversion, please checkout the latest
version and start SPE with:
pythonw SPE.py

Thanks,
Stani

Hi Hraban,

Is bug 004639 still present? If yes, I'd like to close it.
http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=4639&group_id=4161

I could already fix quite some Mac bugs, but unfortunately SVN seems down,
so I commit later. The segfaulting of the class browser is solved now.
Realtime updating of the sidebar works smoothly now, whatever you try
(multiple classes with same name, etc..) Moreover I couldn't crash SPE on
the Mac anymore. But I hope someone will.

Command 'pythonw SPE.py' doesn't work (at least for me), if one don't  
install the latest subversion checkout to Python's site-packages  
directory.
To launch it directly over the latest subversion checkout, command  
'pythonw _spe/SPE.py' will do. Of 'coz your current working directory  
does matter, in former case, you are in the '_spe' sub-directory; in  
latter case, you are in the parent directory of '_spe'.

I confirmed that the default font (at least for the text editor) is  
very small for me as well.
Worse yet, just find out that I can't open the Preferences dialog via  
menu "Python/Preferences...". The exception is:
------
Traceback (most recent call last):

------
Looks like another wxPython bug, so I cross-post it to dev list as well.
I will submit this as a bug shortly after.

Hey, I'm trying to post a bug and the bug tracker won't let me log  
on. I shouldn't need to create a new, separate account for this; I  
should be able to use this account, shouldn't I?

The bug, BTW, is

1) Select a block of text
2) Single click inside the selection block
3) Single click outside the selection block

SPE goes into an infinite loop and must be killed with Force Quit.

This actually looks more like a wxWindows bug. Let me know if I  
should or should not post this.

This is a wxMac bug, as it is reproducable on the wxPython Demo
StyledTextControl. The bug is even worse:
1) Select a block of text
2) Single click inside the selection block
You don't need even step 3! Please post this at the wxMac/wxPython Mailing
list.

Well Richard, thank you, finally I get some feedback.  I hope everyone on
this list who had subversions tries out the latest release. SPE runs
smoothly on my mac, so I hope to share that. I still believe some bugs might
be hidden and it's up to you all to help reveal them for me.

That's the same configuration as I have and which I would recommend for
everyone as it seems to me not so wise to change the installed system.

I agree, I'll fix that. However this is different on Windows, as with
pythonw there is no console output.

2b) If I copy/paste the command line, I get an error using tcsh:
>
> -----------
> richb% pythonw SPE.py --debug > debug.txt 2>&1
> tcsh: Ambiguous output redirect.
> -----------


This is an issue I have absolute no knowledge about. I'll post this question
on the spe-dev mailing list, unless one of you knows how to redirect the
output in an not ambiguous way.

3)      The page at:
http://www.stani.be/python/spe/page_download_berlioshas a bad

I know, maybe I have to write my  own page for subversion. Unfortunately,
there is no way I can edit this page.

4)      I get an error when I try to run the current source. I checked out

SPE requires you put in your site-packages directory. Otherwise it won't
work. So for ActivePython2.4.2 this is:
 /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe/
Let me know if you get the same error when spe is there. What I do is create
an alias in my .bash_profile:

export
PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH:/Developer/Tools:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/"
alias spe='pythonw
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe/SPE.py'

alias winpdb='pythonw
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe/plugins/winpdb/winpdb.py
-t'
alias spe_debug='pythonw
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe/plugins/winpdb/winpdb.py
-t -c
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe/SPE.py
--debug'

In this way you can use: spe, winpdb, spe_debug always from the shell. As a
Mac newbie, I don't know if it is possible to make a desktop alias similar
to these bash aliases.

I guess I should make add a section in the manual with instructions how to
install SPE on Mac OsX


5)      If I cd .., and invoke the spe shell script (which simply imports
> _spe.SPE),
> I also get an error:
>
> -----------
> richb% ./spe
> Traceback (most recent call last):

> wxversion.VersionError: wxversion.ensureMinimal() must be called before

> richb%
> -----------


I can confirm this. I'll try to fix it.

6)      So how do I get the current version of SPE to run?


See nr.4 Please do let me know asap if you can get SPE to run.

Best regards on the day after the American Thanksgiving Holiday,


Well, let SPE be my present. Try to open it!

Hi All, Hi Stani,

I'm trying to make the speMac.blend (in fact the spe-editor script for 
blender) more a general solution for any flavor of Python and OS.

I'm running into the difficulty of determing the kind of install and os, 
and the code is getting longer and less elegant.

the solution I'm currently thinking of is to use the PYTHONPATH and/or 
PYTHON environment var, for the construction of the modules path and the 
location of wx.pth. Caveat is that this needs to be set.

the other option would be to use regular expression and scan through 
sys.path and get the site-packages path from there.
This wouldn't fail if the environment is not set.

A combination of the two ways, i think, would be failsafe, so if no 
PYTHONPATH is found, do the regex over sys.path list.

Any opinions Mates?

Hi Rich,

Great! I fixed the two things (pythonw and spe script) I said and will now
write a chapter about how to install spe on the Mac. So there is a new
subversion, so you can check it out.

Also only run some code snippets inside SPE. To run serious programs use:
Tools>Run in terminal
or
Tools>Debug with winpdb

Look at the statusbar, it will warn you when you type errors! (new feature)

Hi Kay,

Well, I was thinking about this two and I think that maybe it's better to
offer two blender files, which means one for mac seperately. The standard
spe.blend works with all python flavors on windows and linux(?), so if you
make just one which works on Mac that's ok for me.

Message-ID: <2078a7ad0511250819x8c64212k1c57aab806f755@mail.gmail.com>

The following questions are specifically about Mac. Probably you might know,
which I as a Mac newbie don't. So here we go...

* Child.py: How do I close a terminal window with apple script?

 For the Tools menu 'Run in terminal and exit', I wrote the following code
which works fine but I would prefer if the window closes. Anybody know why?
os.system("""osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal"' -e 'activate' -e 'do
script with command "cd %(path)s;pythonw %(file)s;logout"' -e 'end
tell'"""%params)

So the apple script is:

tell application "Terminal"
 activate
 do script with command "cd %(path)s;pythonw %(file)s;logout"
 -> what should be put here to close the window?
end tell

* SPE.py: How to redirect the shell on Mac? (reported by Rich):

If I copy/paste the command line, I get an error using tcsh:

-----------
richb% pythonw SPE.py --debug > debug.txt 2>&1
tcsh: Ambiguous output redirect.
-----------

* I'm wondering if is possible make desktop/finder aliases like
.bash_profile aliases:

alias spe='pythonw
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe/SPE.py'


Of course I could make a python script (as I did: SPE_DEBUG.py) and make an
alias to that, but I was just curious.

Thanks in advance,

Stani

Subject: [spe-mac] mac installation instructions (please review)
Message-ID: <2078a7ad0511250925v616a986arcbe42aecb8d0181c@mail.gmail.com>

These are the instructions I wrote for the manual. Please let me know your
remarks, both on content and english:
Introduction

Mac Os X provides itself wxPython. Unfortunately there is a big chance that
this version is outdated. Therefore following instructions 'Python' and
'wxPython' will explain you how to install wxPython yourself. You only have
to follow them in case the python and wxPython versions of your Os X are not
matching SPE's requirements, otherwise only follow the 'SPE' instruction.

At the moment of this writing the latest version of Os X is Tiger (10.4). It
ships with Python 2.3 and wxPython 2.5. For SPE you'll need wxPython 2.6 and
at least Python 2.3 In order not to interfere with the installed system,
this manual will explain you how to install Python2.4 with wxPython2.6 In
general it is always better to use a later version of Python as mostly it is
more stable and faster.
Python

Activestate provides nicely wrapped installers for Python for Mac Os X.
Download it and launch the installer. Choose the latest Python version for
Mac Os X from:

http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Download.plex?id=ActivePython

In order to let this python version precede, edit the following line your
'.bash_profile'. This file is located in your home directory. If it doesn't
exist, create an empty text file with this name in your home folder. Don't
skip this step or your installation will fail! Close afterwards all terminal
windows (to make sure that the PATH variable is exported).

export PATH = "/usr/local/bin:$PATH:/Developer/Tools:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/"

 WxPython

Download the latest binary built for the Python version you installed from:

http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#binaries

   -

   You can install packages for OsX 10.3 also on 10.4 The
wxPython.orgwebsites mentions: "
   *Eventhough the Panther packages below were built on an OSX
10.3system they will still work on Tiger provided you also have this
package
   installed.*" You can safely ignore this message.

Launch the installer.
SPE

At the moment SPE is not yet available as an application. Download the
source distribution tar.gz instead. Unpack it to a certain path and open a
new terminal in that path. In the terminal enter the following command:

python setup.py install

 This installs SPE in the site-packages directory of your default Python
installation. You can now create aliases for the terminal by adding these
lines in your '.bash_profile':

alias spe='pythonw
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe/SPE.py'
alias winpdb='pythonw
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe/plugins/winpdb/winpdb.py
-t'
alias debug_spe='pythonw
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe/plugins/winpdb/winpdb.py
-t -c /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe/SPE.py
--debug'



 Starting SPE is now as easy as typing 'spe' in the terminal. You can also
type 'spe ?debug' to run SPE in debugging mode.
Uninstall

Remove the '_spe' folder from your python site-packages directory, eg:


 /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/site-packages


 One needs also to remove
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/bin/spe manually.

hey Stani,

meanwhile I tried to implement the suggestion made.
I attached the code for inspection.

the recognition works fine ... so far. except for PYTHONPATH, as stated 
in the comment, it needs some regex too. Or I just skip that, and stick 
with the sys.path.

I tried it with blender 2.37 works perfect. With blender 2.40 SPE 
wouldn't work, but only due to wxversion problems ...
That Bug is reproducable with the old script too ...

 >debug output:
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "spe editor", line 14, in ?
   File 
"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe/SPE.py",

wxversion.VersionError: wxversion.ensureMinimal() must be called before 
wxPython is imported


with blender 2.37 python 2.3 is used, so the old SPE Release kicks in, 
thats 0.7.5.f, which I have installed under 2.3.
My Blender 2.40 version comes from 
http://blendertestbuilds.de/index.php?dir=Testbuilds/Blender/MacOSX/BrianH/
and is the Blender-18-Nov-2005-OSX.dmg build.
That version uses python 2.4.0 and so the current _spe checkout from 
subversion.

hope this helps ...

Which subversion did you use? I think I fixed that now. It is related to
another bug. The first lines in _spe/__init__.py should be:
##import info
##INFO=info.copy()
##INFO['description']=\
##"""This is the main spe application."""
##__doc__=INFO['doc']%INFO

But please check out again. I do commits *very* often. I'll do one again in
some minutes ;-)

Send me your .blend file. I'll trust you. I don't have blender yet installed
on my mac mini and I prefer to work on other issues of SPE.

Hi Stani,

did the update and revision is 81, __init__.py has the lines but the bug 
remains the same ...

same output as before ...

for .blend File, I'll again name it speMac.blend and will stick with the 
  sys.path thing and get rid of the PYTHONPATH.

I'll rework that if there is any necessity for it.

file comes in a minute ...

Hi Stani,

here the new speMac.blend.
its without the PYTHONPATH checking, only getting site-packages form 
sys.path.

works so far.

Only thing that happens to me today, is that blender crashes when i quit 
  spe. have to investigate that ...
I'll let you know if its reoccurring.

What happens if you do 'import _spe.SPE' in a normal python shell, not in
Blender. Does it work then?

Thanks! Maybe in the future this is more something for spe-dev mailing list
if you don't mind.

Please do, especially if you know why and even better how to fix it!

Rich & Stani,

Here's one I can help with!

There are two shells available in the MacOS version of UNIX: tcsh and 
bash.  To the expert they differ in myriad important and useful ways, 
but to the casual user they are essentially the same -- you type a 
command name and it's arguments in that order and it executes the 
command.  One of the differences is in how they do redirection of 
standard-error.  That's the "2>&1" part of the above command line.  
This is written in the bash dialect, and you are using the tcsh 
dialect.  The version of the command line for tcsh would be:

	pythonw SPE.py --debug >& debug.txt

The bigger problem of "which shell should I use?" is a largely 
"religious" issue.  There are strong partisans on all sides.  
(Amazingly, bash and tcsh are just the tip of the iceberg.  There are 
dozens of shells out there.  Fortunately most have a small user 
community.)  Most people who know both say that bash is better for 
programming and tcsh is better for interactive use, but to me it's 
mostly a matter of what you're used to.  If you're not used to either, 
I'd pick bash because it's what's standard in Linux.  But on the other 
hand, tcsh is what's standard in MacOS-X, so there are arguments on 
both sides.

Bottom line:  Read The Fine Manuals -- "man tsch" and "man bash" -- and 
decide for yourself which you prefer.

In MacOSX you must use the "netinfo manager" gui utility to change your 
default shell.  Here's a step-by-step:

	*) open Netinfo Manager (it's in the Utilities folder which is in the 
Applications folder)
	*) in the second column is a list of object classes.  Click on users.
	*) in the third column will appear a list of users.  Click on your 
user name.  In the lower panel will appear a list of attributes.  They 
will be greyed out.
	*) click the lock icon at the bottom left.  Type your password in the 
popup window as requested.  The attributes will no longer be greyed 
out.
	*) scroll the lower panel to "shell".  Double click in the "value" 
part of that line.
	*) replace the letters "tcsh" with "bash" or vice versa as necessary.
	*) click the lock to grey out the lower panel again.
	*) quit netinfo manager.
The next time you open a terminal window, you will be using your new 
shell.  (Or maybe you'll have to log out and log back in again -- I 
forget.)

Warning!  Netinfo manager is *very* powerful magic.  Be extremely 
careful what you do with it.  It's possible to dig yourself a hole that 
you can't get out of.

Make Love; make Peace; make Music; make good free software!

Hi Rick,
Thanks! I had the right comment already figured with the help of Hraban. So
the SVN is already updated. However all the information about the shells is
new to me and therefore interesting. Let me know if you have any difficulty
with running SPE.
Thanks,
Stani

No bash is also standard in 10.4 Try this out:
$python
>>> import os
>>> print os.environ['SHELL']
'bin/bash'

tcsh was default in 10.2, but bash since 10.3
(and I think that was a good decision ;-)

Subject: [spe-mac] bugs: blender crash on SPE exit; SPE opens argv of blender as files
Message-ID: <4387A407.2050601@merz-akademie.de>

Hi Stani,

Bug 1: Blender Crashes with Segmentation Fault when SPE is quit

because neither SPE debug nor Blender debug helped, I used gdb to trace 
the problem.

here is the output of the debugger from the crash:

Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.
0x09141644 in wxStyledTextCtrl::SendMsg(int, long, long) ()

the complete trace:

#122 0x8fe1a278 in __dyld__dyld_start ()

so it seems its wx that causes the crash ...
neither spe nor blender are the problem, but the wx module

If I shall post that to the wx bugtracker, please gimme a hint where to 
find it ...


Bug 2:

If I use command line options, like -d or a combination like -d -w -p 10 
10 800 600 when I start blender, every single argv
(from blender -d output):

argv[1] = -d
argv[2] = -w
argv[3] = -p
argv[4] = 10
argv[5] = 10
argv[6] = 800
argv[7] = 600

will be opened as a file in spe, when I launch it from inside blender, 
plus the workspace files.

thats irritating but not very harmful.

I updated and checked this with all the new versions (former bug report 
was with old blender, spe and python):
blender 2.40, python 2.4.1, wxPython 2.6.1.0 and the current svn version

things are a bit different.

launching from blender works fine, quit is also okay, as far as the spe 
window gets destroyd and the focus is back to blender.

but I'm not able to relaunch spe, neither to execute any python script.

accessing Help, in the apple menue, shows me still the Menue from the 
python execution, namely the links to Python and wxPython docs.
trying to activate them, crashes blender.

as it seems, wx does not quit, and keeps python alive somehow, but 
crashes on access and takes blender with it.

here is the trace:

Subject: [spe-mac] SPE 0.8.0.a released!
Message-ID: <2078a7ad0511261445g55f1357eu8c0b5b12a56627cf@mail.gmail.com>

Dear SPE users,

Let me pre-announce SPE 0.8.0.a This is a major step forward for all
platforms, especially for MacOS X.

This new release brings you basic project management through workspaces
(thanks to Thurston Stone), an improved sidebar and pydoc viewer. This is
the first release which is also developed and tested on the Mac. If SPE is
stable enough, I'll try to build SPE as an application for the Mac. This
version aims stability, so please help to report and fix all bugs!

The advertisements on SPE's websites generate a moderate, but necesssary
income. From now on if you donate, you can ask me by email an ad-free, nice
pdf version of the manual. I hope this will be a stimulation.

:**New features**:

- stability
- workspaces to manage your projects
- documentation viewer (pydoc)
- smart indentation: dedent after break, return, etc...
- realtime updating of sidebar: explore, todo &amp; index
- check source realtime for syntax errors (optional)
- backup files (.py.bak) are now optional

:**Bug fixes**:

- all these mac bugs are fixed:

 + SPE crashes on close
 + preferences dialog: combobox bug
 + debug dialog: combobox bug
 + wxGlade won't launch
 + winPdb won't launch
 + 2x window menu bug
 + context menu bug
 + open &amp; run in terminal emulator
 + pythonw debug message
 + spe script bug
 + exception when closing file
 + PyChecker

:**Installation**:

See http://pythonide.stani.be/manual/html/manual2.html There is now an
update section for MacOS X!

:**Contributors**:

- Thurston Stone (workspaces)
- Glenn Washburn (patches)
- Henning Hraban Ramm (Mac support)
- Kay Fricke (Mac support)
- Stefan Csomor (wxMac support)
- and many more...

:**Donations**:

Special thanks to Richard Brown of Dartware for starting the fund raising
campaign of the mini-mac for SPE. A lot of the donations below are done
specifically for this purpose. Impressive that the smallest user base of SPE
generated generously the largest donations ever. Many thanks. Maybe it's
time now for Window and Linux users to catch up!

- Dartware (250 euro)
- Rick Thomas (161 euro)
- Brian Myers (100 euro)
- Advanced Concepts AG (50 euro)
- Ernesto Costa (50 euro)
- Henning Hraban Ramm (50 euro)
- Peter Koppatz (50 euro)
- Kevin Murphy (50 euro)

Hi Stani,

Great to hear the plans ... and thanx very much for the credits.

so here comes straight a bit info about from my testing tour:

1.) Worskpace Issue
If you try to save a workspace without any file open, spe crashes ...
True its a dumb idea to do that, but this error should be catched, and 
gracefully handled with a dialog that explains something.

2.) Tools Menue
- Kiki is not launching:

2005-11-27 02:12:54.199 open[781] LSOpenFromURLSpec() returned -1 for 
application /Applications/SPE-OSX/KikiOSX.app path (null).
2005-11-27 02:12:54.199 open[781] Couldn't launch application: 
/Applications/SPE-OSX/KikiOSX.app

3.) Tooltips for the Buttons
- Showing the Windows keyboard shortcuts (ctrl-Z for undo, alt-F4 for 
quit etc.)

4.) Tabs
- In the Find Tab the Results, i guess ListCtrl, is so big that it 
overlays the tab buttons, (my screen is 1024x768), so i have to resize 
the panel to change to another tab

- Notes Tab, or also in Sidebar
typed Text is only fully visible after a return, only a few pixels of 
the cursor are blinking

- Tooltips for the Tab-Buttons would be a nice to have

5.) Show/Hide Shell
- doesn't change the view

6.) Blender and Spe
(I think we delay this issues until all other things are stable, so this 
is just for book)
- Still blender python hangs when spe is quit.
   Same problem as reported.

- the Menue Functions and Buttons for blender don't work, neither 
'Redraw Blender Window' nor 'Open in Blender', and 'Reference in Blender'

- Workspace is different from that of the lone standing spe
   - After launch in blender, workspace for lonestanding is empty
   - relaunch in blender shows the files edited under blender start

- Blender Tab, the leftmost Scroll List is not selectable


Sorry that its just that unordered issue list, next time i'll try to be 
a bit more orderly ...

greetz to all, and have a nice sunday

kay

As I want to speed up the development and not getting too much feedback on
the subversion, I tought it was time for a release ;-) Moreover this version
is anyway better than any previous one.

so here comes straight a bit info about from my testing tour:

Can you send me the error log. I agree with you, but I couldn't reproduce
the error on Windows XP SP2 or MacOS X 10.4. So then I know what to fix.

2.) Tools Menue

Fixed in subversion.

3.) Tooltips for the Buttons
> - Showing the Windows keyboard shortcuts (ctrl-Z for undo, alt-F4 for
> quit etc.)


I now fixed to replace Ctrl with Cmd (is this ok?), but with what should I
replace Alt?  In subversion, _spe/Menu.py:
def _(x):
    if '|' in x and info.DARWIN:
        return x.replace('Ctrl','Cmd')
    else:

Yes, Blender support is postponed, as Blender 2.40 is not stable itself
(especially concerning sys.path). You can put them in the bug tracker. Put
them in category 'Plugin'.

- Still blender python hangs when spe is quit.

the Tooltips show alt-F4 for quit, which is Cmd-Q on the make. Thats 
right in the Menues, only Toolstips for the buttons in the Toolbar are 
still Win-Style.

maybe also an Issue:
- a few F-Keys seem to be reserved for Finder Behaviours, here its F9 
and F11

I'll test that anyways, 'cause its my main goal at the moment, to do 
some Blender Scripting with Spe on the mac ... :D so I'll update here 
with alll the new blender-builds I get.

I can't use the menu "Tools / Browse folder" after syncing to rev#85,  
revert back to rev#84 also have the same problem.

The stack trace is:

Is such info enough?

Actually I have to discover how to label releases in SVN. Is there anyone
using TortoiseSVN who can explain me quickly? But to answer your question
the first one, so if SPE 0.8.0.a starts with 81, it's 81.
Thanks,

It works for me on Tiger. How can I open a folder from Python in MacOS X? I
do it with webbrowser.start. It seems to work on all platforms.

Mine is Tiger as well (10.4.3). :-)
Actually, I know why I had the problem but you didn't. I used this  
function when no file was opened. When there is at least a file  
opened, the "Tools / Browse folder" works fine. So I made such fix:
------

Subject: [spe-mac] NotebookCtrl Widget Problem On Mac FIXED!!
Message-ID: <2078a7ad0511301215j398c0bf6k8f7b78dfd997ff35@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Andrea,

Thanks to SPE Mac users who sponsered SPE with a Mini Mac, I was able to
debug your control with winpdb debugger. So now the light is green to get
your control into SPE.

After plunging in the code, I managed to get the control working. The
problem is that wxMac doesn't seem to support the wx.DefaultSize (-1,-1)
which is always transformed in (0,0). So setting the size to like
wx.Size(28,28)
solves the issue. I'll email you privately with the patch.

I'm not sure if it is 100% stable. I found some bugs, which I also will send
to you.

For those who like to see the screenshot:
http://pythonide.stani.be/images/NotebookCtrl.png

Best regards,
Stani

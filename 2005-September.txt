Subject: [spe-mac] GUI interfaces won't work.
Message-ID: <07B6F5B5-2196-11DA-BCCB-000A95C1A12A@battlefoundry.net>

So this is my first look at SPE, and I can easily forsee this being my 
one and only editor - that is, if I can get it to work. Here's the 
problem I'm having.

I'm trying to construct GUI's right now, but when I do Tools > design a 
gui with wxGlade, nothing happens. Over in the terminal, it gives the 
readout...

2005-09-09 19:20:22.961 open[673] LSOpenFromURLSpec() returned -1 for 
application /Applications/SPE-OSX/wxGladeOSX.app path (null).
2005-09-09 19:20:22.963 open[673] Couldn't launch application:  
/Applications/SPE-OSX/wxGladeOSX.app

Likewise, Tools > design a gui with XRC does nothing as well, and gives 
a similar readout:

2005-09-09 19:50:28.107 open[679] LSOpenFromURLSpec() returned -1 for 
application /Applications/SPE-OSX/XRCed.app path (null).
2005-09-09 19:50:28.108 open[679] Couldn't launch application:  
/Applications/SPE-OSX/XRCed.app

SPE is supposed to come packaged with wxGlade and XRC, but perhaps 
that's just the Mac version. In any case, I can't get the referenced 
wxGladeOSX.app, because the site that's supposed to be hosting it  
(http://www.wordtech-software.com/wxglade.htm) is down. Unfortunately, 
as I'm writing this, SourceForge is down as well, so downloading XRC is 
equally impossible. So the question:

1. If I do manage to find a copy of wxGladeOSX.app, should I create 
~/Applications/SPE-OSX/, and place it in there, will that make it work?

2. If yes, could someone point me to a place where I could download 
this app?

Thanks in advance,

			-Lemon

Hi
 
looking at the "Console" (MacSpeak, "Terminal" for everybody else ;-)
output I assume it should be a /Applications not at ~/Applications,
that't the place where they are in my version as well.
 
I've put my 'old' wxGlade Download from Kevin's site onto my idisk :
 
http://idisk.mac.com/csomor-Public/wxGladeOSX-0.3.5.1.zip
 
XRCEd should be part of your wxPython osx-docs-demos download, just move
it to the SPE-OSX folder.
 
HTH

Er, yeah /Applications is what I meant. What I meant was: the download 
I got from the SPE site had an install applet which  put everything 
into Library/Python/2.3/_spe. An Applications/ SPE-OSX folder was never 
made.

Looking over it now I see that the previously mentioned site (wordtech 
software) seems to have hosted an OSX built .app version of SPE. Are 
most people using that? I've been running off the source code download 
(using PythonLauncher to run SPE.py), as I haven't yet developed the 
Pythonic confidence to try to compile anything yet.

I appreciate that greatly.

Downloading now, and we'll see if it solves the problems.

Hi
 
ok, I'll copy an archive of the SPE-OSX download from Kevin at
 
http://idisk.mac.com/csomor-Public/SPE-OSX.dmg
 
it contains wxGlade and XRCEd, Drag the Disk into the Applications
Folder
 
for updating you can then eg go into the SPE-OSX folder (Put that into
/Applications) , do a context click on the SPE-OSX icon, choose 'Show
Package...' then dive into Contents/Resources and replace the folders
there with the new download version
 
HTH

Again, a thousand thank you. I haven't yet given it a thorough look, 
but it is up and running, and without the severe type lag and 
philisophical "creating .py files with a .py file" difficulty I was 
having previously, so I'm a good deal happier.

Incidentally, you might want to scrutinize that other wxGlade link. It 
was 9.2M (twice the size of the other package, which included SPE, 
Kiki, XRCed and wxGlade itself, and was prone to crashing quite a bit.

Again - thanks.

Hi

was 9.2M (twice the size of the other package, which included SPE, Kiki,
XRCed and wxGlade itself, and was prone to crashing quite a bit.  
 
yes, the wxGlade zip package contains the wxlibrary unicode debug
version as a dylib itself (7.4MB) , which the SPE-OSX variante doesn't
have.
 
Glad it is starting to work out
 
Best,
 
Stefan

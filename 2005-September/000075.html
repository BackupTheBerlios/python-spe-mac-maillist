<PRE>So this is my first look at SPE, and I can easily forsee this being my 
one and only editor - that is, if I can get it to work. Here's the 
problem I'm having.

I'm trying to construct GUI's right now, but when I do Tools &gt; design a 
gui with wxGlade, nothing happens. Over in the terminal, it gives the 
readout...

2005-09-09 19:20:22.961 open[673] LSOpenFromURLSpec() returned -1 for 
application /Applications/SPE-OSX/wxGladeOSX.app path (null).
2005-09-09 19:20:22.963 open[673] Couldn't launch application:  
/Applications/SPE-OSX/wxGladeOSX.app

Likewise, Tools &gt; design a gui with XRC does nothing as well, and gives 
a similar readout:

2005-09-09 19:50:28.107 open[679] LSOpenFromURLSpec() returned -1 for 
application /Applications/SPE-OSX/XRCed.app path (null).
2005-09-09 19:50:28.108 open[679] Couldn't launch application:  
/Applications/SPE-OSX/XRCed.app

SPE is supposed to come packaged with wxGlade and XRC, but perhaps 
that's just the Mac version. In any case, I can't get the referenced 
wxGladeOSX.app, because the site that's supposed to be hosting it  
(<A HREF="http://www.wordtech-software.com/wxglade.htm">http://www.wordtech-software.com/wxglade.htm</A>) is down. Unfortunately, 
as I'm writing this, SourceForge is down as well, so downloading XRC is 
equally impossible. So the question:

1. If I do manage to find a copy of wxGladeOSX.app, should I create 
~/Applications/SPE-OSX/, and place it in there, will that make it work?

2. If yes, could someone point me to a place where I could download 
this app?

Thanks in advance,

			-Lemon

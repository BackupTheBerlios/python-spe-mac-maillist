Hi all,
Please test if this file runs well on Mac (not other os):

    * The only purpose of this file is to provide a single document
      interface with tab functionality to switch between files.
    * Start the application and open with file>new some child windows.
      Look when you close if some errors happen
    * Don't test it as an editor. The application on itself has no use.
    * Don't test shortcuts.
    * Send also screenshot of full desktop with Parent and some Child
      windows as png or gif (one is enough not to spoil this mailing
      list, so who is first?!)

Thanks,
Stani

Hi Stani!

It doesn't throw any exceptions, but unfortunately it doesn't do what  
it should either:
You can make and close children at will, but if you click on the  
tabs, nothing happens. Changing to the window via Windows menu works.
Parent comes up in some default size (see screenshot), children are  
maximized.

Greetlings,
Hraban

Hi Hraban,
Looking to the screenshot, I have the following questions:
- are there two parent windows (one with toolbar and one with tabs)?!
- it is weird that nothing happens when you click on the tabs, not even 
an error. Can you please execute this smdi.py (has only some more print 
statements) and send me the log file(debug.txt):
python spe.py --debug.txt>debug.txt
- maybe some of you could plunge into the code and try to find out why a 
window is not raised: The windows should be raised by 
TabUnix.onFrameTab  which calls Tabs.raiseTab, which raises the actual 
MdiTabsChildFrame (of which the Raise method is overwritten by its 
Activate method). The bug should be obvious, which is a little bit 
frustrating, as I can not test it on a Mac.

Thanks,
Stani

Hi all,
Now I implemented all the document interfaces I wanted. Now it should be 
possible to run SPE on any platform how you prefer it single versus 
multiple document interface. So SPE can adapt itself as a kameleon. It 
would be nice if this would work smoothly, so let's get all the bugs out!

1) For the mac tab lovers, this is my own implementation for those who 
prefer a multiple document interface probably like safari. Please test 
if this file runs well on Mac (not other os):

    * Start the application and open with file>new some child windows.
      Look when you close if some errors happen
    * Don't test it as an editor. The application on itself has no use.
    * Don't test shortcuts.
    * Send also screenshot of full desktop with Parent and some Child
      windows as png or gif
    * This test is not about the toolpalette

2) I REALLY need your help to solve the single document interface, which 
remained unsolved by lack of feedback. As I don't have a mac, I can't 
debug it and it should not be too difficult for you. I quote from my 
previous mail:

> Looking to the screenshot, I have the following questions:

To switch between document interfaces 1 and 2 in smdi.py SPE comment and 
uncomment one of the last lines:
if __name__=='__main__':
    #__test__(debug=1,mdi=MDI_TABS_WIN)#single document interface for mac
    __test__(debug=1,mdi=MDI_SPLIT_ALL)#multiple document interface for mac

In general this smdi is more stable as the previous version, I removed 
some code which might provoque segmentation faults and the like.

Thanks,
Stani

Will SPE work with the "out of the box" Tiger wx* stack?

I'm not sure if I understand you. I'm now trying to implement SPE on the 
Mac in the best way possible. smdi.py is the framework for document 
interfaces on which SPE is built. It can run independently as a useless 
program, but very helpful to debug. If smdi.py is bugfree, than already 
the most of the cross-platform bugs are solved. If your question is 
about subversion, than I have to answer not yet. I have no experience 
with SVN at the moment and I prefer now to devote my time on developping 
SPE. When SPE is stable, I want to learn SVN to make the collaboration 
more easy.

It depends if Tiger ships with wxPython2.6.1 (maybe also 2.5.4.1+), yes, 
otherwise no. But if I understood well, SPE can be packed with py2app to 
run independently as an application. Actually it would be nice if SPE is 
stable for mac that it ships with OsX.

Yeah -- I was more or less asking if there was a repository somewhere  
via which one can check out SPE and do 'svn update' to track your  
development.

Subversion is remarkably forgiving given that you can easily rename  
and/or move stuff around after the fact, unlike CVS.   For initial  
development, about all you need to know is 'svn add file' and 'svn  
commit file'.   I would encourage you to take a few minutes to pick  
it up if only such that the rest of us can track your work a bit more  
easily and, possibly/hopefully, contribute a patch or two. :-)

Let me know if you have any questions about Subversion -- I'd be  
happy to help.

OK.

If SPE uses the python distutils stuff, then py2app will happen  
automatically with a little tweaking here and there.  I think I can  
figure that part out assuming the underlying bits and pieces are  
fairly straightforward.

Tiger ships with Python 2.3.5 and wx 2.5.3 - that is rather broken,  
and every Mac-Python guru tells you it makes no sense to NOT upgrade  
to Python 2.4.x and wx 2.6.x.

BTW sorry that I didn't answer yet - I've to work night shifts  
(again) at the moment and some other projects running (struggling  
with LilyPond music typesetting and its integration into ConTeXt...)

Now it works!
You see a very small visual-only issue in the "empty" screenshot:
There's some garbage of the last tab after closing all children; it  
disappears at a resize.

Ha good! But I want the single document interface also to work before 
proceeding. Please run this smdi.py I have to repeat... I REALLY need 
your help to solve the single document interface. As I don't have a mac, 
I can't debug it and it should not be too difficult for you. I quote

I can live with that. An option would be to start a new file if all are 
closed.

Thanks, now I hope we can solve the single document interface as well. 
If that's ready it should be time for a poll, what should be the default 
interface for a mac (always changable in preferences of course): single 
or multiple documeninterface, toolbar or toolpalette. To me it looks 
that single document interface with tool palette, would be the most Mac 
minded.

Ok, I'll have a look at it now, but don't promise anything yet. ;-)

So, let's get SPE stable soon and debug the single document interface, 
see my previous post with smdi.py

Dear all,

Some of you contacted to warn me that my site is down. Thanks for your 
concerns. Unfortunately the *.stani.be site drove the machine's load up 
to 27 at the Zettai server. This made my site crash and I had to restart 
it frequently. For Zettai, who sponsors SPE in free hosting, this was 
alarming and they decided to shut down my site. Altough I'm experienced 
with Python, I'm not that familiar with Zope. Anyone who could help me 
monitoring what is wrong or even point me to how I could solve the 
problem, would save my days.

I'm currently trying to convince Zettai to see if there is a way to 
continue the SPE website. I have no reasons to complain about them, the 
opposite: they always provided me with an excellent service, so I can 
recommend them to anyone. Honnestly I think that their analysis that 
something is alarmlingly wrong is very justified.

The SPE website uses CoreBlog and I don't think that can be the problem. 
My personal portfolio site www.stani.be uses a lot of Python scripting, 
but has low visitors. So in a way I would be surprised if it's that. 
When the problem occurred, I installed cache managers, but appearantly 
that didn't solve anything.

Recently I have put a lot of effort to develop SPE, especially 
concerning Mac Os X, new website and integrating the debugger. Of course 
this will postpone the release of SPE. The reason is that first this 
will take me time and energy to see what is wrong and to get it back 
online. The second reason is that the google ads displayed on my page 
give me a very small income. I'm donating much of my freetime into this 
project and as donations are seldom and small, any extra income is 
welcome. It's at the moment the only way to generate some revenue with 
open source, as far as I know. This income is mainly generated when 
there is a new release, so I feel it is only reasonable as a developper 
not too lose that opportunity. A company which would sponsor SPE is till 
now still a utopia, or not?

But if some zope expert could help me with solving this problem, please 
contact me. I hope Zettai will continue hosting SPE, otherwise I'll have 
to look for another provider and than everything really gets delayed. 
Also soon I'll have three art shows simultaneously in France, Belgium 
and Germany, so than I have to be away for a while.

PS 1: Please post all replies to python-spe-users at berlios.de

PS 2: Just in case, if someone still wants to donate: 
http://spe.pycs.net/stories/8.html For Mac users or sympathisants, there 
is still a fund raising campaign that I can buy a mini mac, to support 
SPE fully on mac. Pay by iban (europe) or Paypal (s_t_a_n_i at 
yahoo.com) and mention 'mini-mac'

PS 3: This was the data of the zettai server. For me it is Chinese, the 
only hint I got was "keep your scripts under control", but I don't know 
where to start.

Dear all,
The website is up again. Appearantly the screenshots went crazy, so I 
replaced it with a more simple page.

Hi,

I'm now finishing the download page and after that I will release the 
new version of SPE. I just wanted you to know first. So you'll get the 
release soon, it can be any moment from now, but please patient till it 
appears. I'm always looking for people who can do some easy bugfixing, 
if you have a bit of wxPython experience please contact me.

I feel sorry for mac users that I can't make a nice app installer. It 
has one simple reason: I don't have access to a mac. I really appreciate 
the fund raising that some mac users started. If more people would join 
the boat, I could buy a mini mac and give you as well full support on 
Mac Os X.

Of course donations in general are also welcome, as this allows me to 
spend a bit more time on SPE as normal, which you will only enjoy.

Thanks if you consider this seriously.

Stani

I just installed SPE on windows, and once I figure out how to get it  
started, will know if I want to donate to the Mac. So far I've tried  
double-clicking on likely-looking .py files and also tried invoking  
python on the same files from the command line. If someone could tell  
me what the right way to start SPE is, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,
Ken

Hi Kenneth,
I'll reply you privately about windows, otherwise this will go off 
topic. But in general for Mac users, to start SPE (no idea if latest 
versions work, did not get feedback about that): go to the site-packages 
dir and start the file SPE.py in the _spe folder. Install spe with 
'python setup.py install'
Thanks for considering the donation anyway,
Stani

Great! For now it still looks like it will be needed and let's hope 
prices for Mac get down a bit.

Hi Ken and Stefano,
Thanks both for your donations! Finally a snow ball effect today? This 
brings the total amount of received donations up to 466 euro. More with 
the promised amount of Henning, this brings the total amount on 513 
euro. This means that now only 237 euro is missing. (All amounts are 
minus the Paypal fee, so it's really an advantage to pay through IBAN if 
you are in Europe.) Maybe this will stimulate other people as it's not 
unrealistic anymore. Feel free to choose yourself what it would be worth 
for you. It can be anything, but I'd recommend at least 10 euro. It's a 
pitty that no sponsering is available from Macintosh for this, as it is 
only in their benefit. I'll update the homepage, but now I'm just too 
busy with a deadline. However I couldn't wait to share this news.
So I hope to be able to develop SPE for you in september, if some more 
donations drop in. Probably than also I need someone who can give me a 
speed course about mac, eg how to upgrade wxPython, to make an app, etc...
Thanks a lot!
Stani

Stani,

Don't feel you have to take my donation solely as motivation for a  
Mac version. Sure, a Mac version would be great, but a stable Windows  
version and no Mac version would be preferable to less stable  
implementations on both platforms. Take your time, get it right, and  
don't try to do everything at once.


Cheers,
Ken

Too true - I use SPE mostly at work on a WinXP machine, but my  
employer will not pay for anything that seems to be free - i.e. I  
should use the provided MS VisualStudio, and not some Open Source  
stuff...  ;-)
But anyway I'd like to use SPE on my Mac at home, too - even if I'll  
try PyObjC's Xcode integration soon.

You should subscribe to pythonmac-sig mailing list: http:// 
mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pythonmac-sig
The Mac-Python gurus, esp. Bob Ippolito (http://undefined.org/ 
python/), are active there.

MacOS X 10.4 ("Tiger") ships with Python 2.3.x and wxPython 2.5.3 -  
just forget that and install 2.4.1 (Bob's or ActiveState's) and  
latest wxPython.
At best never touch the pre-installed stuff (don't delete it, the OS  
may need it).

If you setup your Mac, make sure you install the BSD subsystem (all  
the useful command line stuff) and Developer Tools (compiler, make etc.)

Ok, I'll repeat that in time. ;-)

I'm just wondering who is the lead developper of MacPython. Is it Jack 
Jansens or Bob Ippolito? Jack Janssens actually lives in Amsterdam, so 
that's on bike distance. And if I understand it right, than Stefan, 
you're the guy behind wxMac? Wow, it's great to have you as a supporter 
and even as a donator! I hope once I bought the Mac, I can fire all more 
intelligent questions on you. How big is the macPython community?

I also would like to see SPE stable. However I believe that testing SPE 
on the Mac, will only increase its stability (rather than seeing it as a 
new feature), as wxMac seems to be more sensitive to mistakes. This 
gives in a way the advantage that errors are more fastly discovered. I 
noticed that with some sizer issues. I think if SPE runs well on Windows 
and Mac, probably it is true for all platforms.

The problems with donations till now, is that people start thinking 
about donating after the features they like are implemented. However 
donations are low. That's why I appreciate the donations for the Mac. 
For the first time users are donating to get something done, before it 
is implemented. This made me think I should start a bounty system, where 
I people could bid on features they would like to see implemented. It's 
not that I want to start earning money with SPE, but on the other hand 
it's also a pitty if things could work better if it is stimulated in 
another way. As you might now, developing a project like this asks a lot 
of time. For example a lot of users ask for a project manager, but would 
they be willing to pay for it? Also if SPE would give in some cash in 
one way or another, I could really spend more time on developping it,as 
it means I have to do less other jobs.

After I will have bought the Mac, I will do some serious bugfixing 
effort to make SPE stable on all platforms or as much as possible. (So 
the sooner I have the money for the Mac, hint, hint, ;-) ...) But of 
course I have the most fun by implementing some new cool features. Also 
I think of organising SPE maybe more like Firefox with downloadable 
extensions (which should also be easy for users to create), rather than 
a full suite which it is now.

These were just some thoughts,
Stani

I understand that, I have to fight it myself :-)  Unfortunately, this  
is serious problem with free software development. (Of course, it's  
also  serious problem in commercial software, but maybe not quite so  
much so.)

Yes, I think that's a very good idea. It will likely make the core  
much more stable, plus force a clean design between the core and the  
plugins.

Cheers,
Ken

One problem i've seen is the plugins don't get updated and the core
changes and the plugins don't work any more. If the features are built
into core they have to keep working with the rest.

I guess it depends on how its managed.

Yes, everything that is not tied to command line tools and configure ;-)
I still have those manuals unread on my shelfs, and since things always
have to be done by yesterday, I still stick to the IDEs and build
procedures I know about...

> How big is the macPython community?

I honestly don't know about that, neither about the part that prefers to
do PyObjC.

Yes, but that's better than the alternative, which is to end up with  
a vast,
unmanageable, and error-ridden core. For example, while I understand
Stani's desire for a Python editor that operates with Blender, that  
feature
should not be part of the core. If SPE becomes a widely used Python
editor, that (and any similarly specialized features) will simply not be
used by the general population, will add unnecessary complexity to
the interface, and will detract from improving and maintaining the core.

The flip side is that a plugin that is extremely useful to a large  
number
of people will probably be well-maintained, and quite possibly  
integrated
into the core. It's an evolutionary process.

As you can tell, I'm a big believer in simpler code. In virtually every
position I've worked in where I had to go into other people's old
code, I've started by ripping out large amount of useless or unnecessary
features, in some cases reducing by codebase by 80%. (I'm not saying
SPE falls into this category!) This was a particular problem at the
Human Genome Project. Once that was done, I could then get to
work on making genuine improvements to reliability and functionality.

"Reliability and simplicity" shouldn't be a mantra for software  
development,
it should be _the_ mantra. Until you've got that as a base, anything you
construct on top will be shaky and ultimate unusable.

Just had to get this rant off my chest, I do it periodically :-)

+100 from me :-) think "RISC" also for software, furthermore composition
of pieces forces to do clean orthogonal concepts, if every evolution
depends on you, then you are the critical path or even the bottleneck of
a software project (I have my share on these experiences :-( , divide
and conquer pays off in software as well

it takes are probably just smart answers on some stupid questions. Anyone?

But, as usual members of the SPE mailing list get first notice about the 
new release:

The next version is ready, it contains:
- better windows installers for python2.3 and 2.4
- a lot of bugfixes (eg call tips and autocompletion)
- local files are now recognized by the debugger and pychecker
- the documentation got a boost thanks to Dimitri Pater 
(http://www.serpia.com), thanks!
- and more...

Half good news for Mac users, the moment that I will buy a Mac is coming 
closer but I still need a bit more than 200 euros. The faster you 
donate, the faster you will get SPE gracefully on Mac.

I try to release it tonight, but dont shoot me if it is tomorrow.

Please consider contributing to SPE. Bugfixing is the best way to know 
its code. I will give you full assistance. Are you native english 
speaking? Please read the manual and take out all the stupid mistakes. 
Do you speak another language. Please translate the manual. For a lot of 
languages people are already translating (even including Chinese!), so 
probably you can just join, to share the cake. Do you have other talents 
(web design, zope, images, photoshop, ...), contact me. Do you have not 
any talent, ok, grab your wallet and donate some money!

All the best,

Stani

PS If you donate for mac, please mention it.

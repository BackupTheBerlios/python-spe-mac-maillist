Subject: [spe-mac] Fund raising for SPE on Mac Os X is great success!!
Message-ID: <2078a7ad0510201230o97509d8lb847d33880361536@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'd like to thank everyone who contributed, especially Richard Brown from
Dartware <http://www.dartware.com/> and Rick Thomas. I'm highly impressed
that the smallest user base of SPE collected the largest donation ever to
SPE. Now it's my turn to impress the SPE Mac users.

As such the light is green for SPE on the Mac. First I will buy a Mac and
get used to it. Then I will optimize SPE for the Mac and try to release
simultaneously. Be patient as this will take some time. The next releases (
0.7) will be based on work I did before. But from 0.8 releases SPE will also
be tested & developed on Mac.

Please subscribe to the mailing list as a
developer<https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/python-spe-dev>,
user <https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/python-spe-users> and/or mac
user <https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/python-spe-mac>. Of course
donations <http://www.stani.be/python/spe/blog/sm_donate> are still welcome.

Subject: [spe-mac] ANN: SPE 0.7.5.d soon released!
Message-ID: <2078a7ad0510262337u4cd4fc7ck43be556ac0aa7dfa@mail.gmail.com>

I'm currently packaging the new SPE. The release is a matter of minutes.
Next releases (0.8.*) will focus on the Mac in honour of the fund raising
for the purchase of a Mac. Read more on the homepage<http://pythonide.stani.be/>
.

  *New features*:

   - UML export to bitmap (bmp, gif, jpg, pcx, png, pnm, tif, xbm, xpm),
   to vector drawing (eps) or to printer (pdf).
   - Dialog box for passing arguments and options to debugger.
   - Unicode support (specify encoding in source file)

  **

 You can read more on the SPE news blog.

It would be nice if some (experienced) Mac users would subscribe to the
developers mailing list to speed up the Mac port for SPE. I expect my new
Mac any moment.

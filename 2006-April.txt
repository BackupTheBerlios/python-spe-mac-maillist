Subject: [spe-mac] french speaking people needed

Hi,
For one of my art projects I desperately need some native french
speakers to help me collecting french antonyms. Contact me privately
on spe.stani.be IatI gmail.com as I have a system set up for it. I
might reward your help with a manual and eternal gratitude.
Thanks in advance,
Stani
PS antonyms in other languages are also welcome, but french is really urgent.

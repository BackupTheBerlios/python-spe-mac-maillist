<PRE>Hi all,

I've been working a lot on fixing SPE and upgrading it with the latest
plugins. The winpdb debugger no longer fails and wxGlade crashes are
history. Is that not great? Are you eager to try it out yourself?
Please do! Get it from subversion and test it for any critical bug, so
I can iron it out. I have been patching a lot for Ubuntu users, who
will be very pleased with this release, and I'd like to thank Jurjen a
lot for his work on Mac issues. This is a definitely a release
everyone should upgrade to, wether you use windows, mac or linux!

Here is an overview what has been done:

The focus in this release is bugfixing, plugin upgrades and
compatibility with wxPython 2.8, but it still works on wxPython 2.6

Upgrades:
- WinPdb to 1.0.8 (not fail in timely manner anymore)
- wxGlade to latest cvs (support for wxWindows2.8)

New features:
- Save as copy
- Clear output pane

Read more and comment at <A HREF="http://pythonide.stani.be">http://pythonide.stani.be</A>

PS. Winpdb does not work well on Mac &amp; wxpython2.8 Nir is working on
an update. So when it comes out it will be included with SPE.

</PRE>

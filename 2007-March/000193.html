<PRE>Hi all,
I am pleased to announce that Jurjen and Andrea will start working on
an application bundle of SPE with py2app. It is still in the very
beginning, so no deadline set yet. However if some of you have
experience with bundling or py2app, please give a helping hand. You'll
make a lot of Mac user happy.
I forward the messages of Jurjen and Andrea, as I want that the
discussion is here so you can give feedback during the process.
Hopefully we can create a nice script, so that afterwards the
application bundle can be built automatically.
Thanks,
Stani

Cool!

Now we have a Mac release team! I hope you both efforts succeed. A lot
of people ask for a Spe package. Before someone has packaged SPE, but
that's long ago. I can send you his latest files. If I find them.

Does py2app comes with a small example? Anyway I have been working
hard on a new way of building the spe setup.py and package. Before my
way of packaging was not 100% correct, but I doubt if that is part of
the problem. You should maybe first try to use py2app for a smaller
demo.

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/py2app/">http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/py2app/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> The installation is easy: first untar the archive and then

</I>&gt;<i> python setup.py install --prefix=$A
</I>&gt;<i> The executables get installed in $A/bin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, a simple run. Run a Terminal session with the environment variable
</I>&gt;<i> export PYTHONPATH=&quot;$A&quot;'/lib/python2.4/site-packages'
</I>&gt;<i> write a simple python script foo.py and issue:
</I>&gt;<i> py2applet --make-setup foo.py
</I>&gt;<i> python setup.py py2app
</I>&gt;<i> (see <A HREF="http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/doc/index.html">http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/doc/index.html</A> )
</I>&gt;<i> We find a foo.app in ./dist. We can double-click it, drag to the dock
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover, packages found in site-packages that are used by the
</I>&gt;<i> application are copied into the bundle, so we should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> distribute it for usage even on those systems that lack some specific
</I>&gt;<i> package.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I do the same thing with the script doodle.py in
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/examples/wxPython/2.4/">http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/examples/wxPython/2.4/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> doodle/
</I>&gt;<i> I get a working GUI application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then I download the SPE source and install it in the same location.
</I>&gt;<i> If I run from the Terminal
</I>&gt;<i> cd &quot;$A&quot;'lib/python2.4/site-packages/_spe'
</I>&gt;<i> python SPE.py
</I>&gt;<i> I get a working session of the editor, so I suppose that SPE.py is
</I>&gt;<i> the main script of the package.
</I>&gt;<i> I use it as target to py2app and everything seems to work fine, and I
</I>&gt;<i> see a lot of files from the wxPython package being copied into the
</I>&gt;<i> bundle.
</I>&gt;<i> But the execution of the bundle fails upon declaring that no
</I>&gt;<i> installation of wxPython is present in the system, and suggesting a
</I>&gt;<i> download.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the problem seems to me merely &quot;formal&quot;, as the scripts after the
</I>&gt;<i> bundling cannot find the path to a wxPython package. I tried to force a
</I>&gt;<i> sys.path.insert(0, './Library ... /site-packages')
</I>&gt;<i> at the very beginning of SPE.py, but nothing changed.
</I>&gt;<i> As we saw that a running bundle of doodle.py can be build
</I>&gt;<i> effortlessly including wxPython, the present failure must be a matter
</I>&gt;<i> of redefining some import - but beats me, the code is quite long to
</I>&gt;<i> find it out!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I apologize for the length of this message, and I would be glad to be
</I>&gt;<i> of any use for solving this issue :-)

site-packages/_spe directory. Can you check that? How did you install the
new version.

Please post on the spe-mac mailing list. I cc'd it for now.

I just checked the archive and it is all there. There should be no
problem. From the error I see, it looks like you forgot to remove first
your old site-packages/_spe directory. Can you check that? How did you

Fixed (as far as possible). (This was the same wx.SplitterWindow issue as
described as above.)

I'm using an 867MHz G4 TiBook, 10.4.4, with 1 GByte of RAM. I'm using
> ActivePython 2.4.2, and using wxPython 2.6.2.1.


Well without my minimac I would *never* have been able to fix these issues.

I'm still checking out things before updating the svn and probably do the
SPE 0.8.2.a release.

Rudolph can you confirm if the &quot;window updating&quot; is the one Richa=

files, it is better to set &quot;check realtime with&quot; to none in
Preferences&gt;Editor if typing would get slow.<br>

Can you check if this is a wxPython issue, by copying&amp;pasting the
same file in the wxPython demo and see if it behaves the same. I
wouldn't know what would cause it too be slow. I'm afraid it is a wxMac
issue.<br>
<br>
I guess snappy is the opposite of sluggish? It might prove it is a wxMac is=
sue. Stefan, any thoughts about this?<br>

The browser is back in town! It is the last tab of the sidebar. I
strongly recommend everyone to read the new SPE tutorial of Dimitri:

wser is explained there.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the browser before (wxPython 2.6.1 ) was buggy and was left
out. From wxPython 2.6.2 it seems functional, but appearantly it has a
bug that when it is inserted in a NotebookCtrl, it forces itself in the
view. This quite annoying, so I was forced to find a solution with the
less glitches as possible.<br>

<PRE>Dear all,

Unfortunately I became sick the day after my last post. I guess I took
Paris flu as a souvenir. I feel better and started working on SPE, on
which I'll report in another mail.

Let me answer your suggestions about my mac mini...

[Ken]
&gt;<i> Paris, ah, I envy you.
</I>Thanks, I had a nice time
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're comfortable with makefiles, compilers, and all that,
</I>&gt;<i> probably the best way would be to compile wxPython into a different
</I>&gt;<i> folder. I've always been pissed off by the fact that Apple never felt
</I>&gt;<i> it appropriate to put in a /usr/local structure, so I'd probably put
</I>&gt;<i> in /usr/local/lib and link against it from there.
</I>Unfortunately I'm not familiar with compiling. I hope to take a more
newbie approach.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once you have something working, _please_ distributes as a full,
</I>&gt;<i> complete, statically linked binary. Memory is cheap, and there's
</I>&gt;<i> really no reason why people should jump through the hoops Apple's non-
</I>&gt;<i> standard directory structure imposes. (Actually, I think most things
</I>&gt;<i> should be distributed in this form anyway.)
</I>I guess you mean py2app? That's the purpose on long run. First I want
to concentrate to get something working.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're from Belgium? Where? My wife and I were just through
</I>&gt;<i> Amsterdam, Bruges, Ypres, and Paris a couple of months ago. Except
</I>&gt;<i> for the high cost of housing, man, I wish I lived in Europe. (Paris
</I>&gt;<i> especially). So much to see, so much to do.
</I>I'm from Belgium, but live in Amsterdam. So next time, ring my bell.

[Hraban]
&gt;<i> I'd suggest to fetch ActivePython 2.4.2 and the latest wxPython -
</I>&gt;<i> don't touch the system installed stuff! Simply put your Python before
</I>&gt;<i> system's in your path.
</I>This approach pleases me, as for now I prefer not to touch the
installed system. I still have too much questions of how to just
handle a mac, so I refrain from fidling around. So Hraban, I guess
I'll bother you ;-)

Stani

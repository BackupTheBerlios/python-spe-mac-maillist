Rich &amp; Stani,

Here's one I can help with!

There are two shells available in the MacOS version of UNIX: tcsh and 
bash.  To the expert they differ in myriad important and useful ways, 
but to the casual user they are essentially the same -- you type a 
command name and it's arguments in that order and it executes the 
command.  One of the differences is in how they do redirection of 
standard-error.  That's the &quot;2&gt;&amp;1&quot; part of the above command line.  
This is written in the bash dialect, and you are using the tcsh 
dialect.  The version of the command line for tcsh would be:

	pythonw SPE.py --debug &gt;&amp; debug.txt

The bigger problem of &quot;which shell should I use?&quot; is a largely 
&quot;religious&quot; issue.  There are strong partisans on all sides.  
(Amazingly, bash and tcsh are just the tip of the iceberg.  There are 
dozens of shells out there.  Fortunately most have a small user 
community.)  Most people who know both say that bash is better for 
programming and tcsh is better for interactive use, but to me it's 
mostly a matter of what you're used to.  If you're not used to either, 
I'd pick bash because it's what's standard in Linux.  But on the other 
hand, tcsh is what's standard in MacOS-X, so there are arguments on 
both sides.

Bottom line:  Read The Fine Manuals -- &quot;man tsch&quot; and &quot;man bash&quot; -- and 
decide for yourself which you prefer.

In MacOSX you must use the &quot;netinfo manager&quot; gui utility to change your 
default shell.  Here's a step-by-step:

	*) open Netinfo Manager (it's in the Utilities folder which is in the 
Applications folder)
	*) in the second column is a list of object classes.  Click on users.
	*) in the third column will appear a list of users.  Click on your 
user name.  In the lower panel will appear a list of attributes.  They 
will be greyed out.
	*) click the lock icon at the bottom left.  Type your password in the 
popup window as requested.  The attributes will no longer be greyed 
out.
	*) scroll the lower panel to &quot;shell&quot;.  Double click in the &quot;value&quot; 
part of that line.
	*) replace the letters &quot;tcsh&quot; with &quot;bash&quot; or vice versa as necessary.
	*) click the lock to grey out the lower panel again.
	*) quit netinfo manager.
The next time you open a terminal window, you will be using your new 
shell.  (Or maybe you'll have to log out and log back in again -- I 
forget.)

Warning!  Netinfo manager is *very* powerful magic.  Be extremely 
careful what you do with it.  It's possible to dig yourself a hole that 
you can't get out of.

Make Love; make Peace; make Music; make good free software!

Rick

<PRE>&gt;<i> Can I suggest others try it and report their results?
</I>
Had a blackout + real life intrude on testing time.... ;-)

Using 0.7.4.x, quick hits:

A PDF of a screenshot at <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/kkrull/FileSharing6.html">http://homepage.mac.com/kkrull/FileSharing6.html</A> :

 1) There are two 'Windows' menu items -- I assume that there should only be one.

 2) On startup, I have 'Unnamed' &amp; 'Unnamed -- SPE 0.7.4.x' windows (see the SPE_windows_OS X.pdf file at the above URL.) If I set my preference to 'Single with tabs (Mac, Windows, Linux), when I open a second file, an additional window is opened, so I have three (untitled, untitled, SPE 0.7.4.x.) Single_with_tabs_not_single.pdf at above URL.

    2.1) when I create new files, they all have the same name.

    2.2) As far as tabs being an OS X thing, I'm not a Mac head by any stretch of the imagination, and I like tab. Safari uses them... Other editors have them -- maybe time for a poll.... ;-)

 3) On menu, second from left, says 'Python' instead of 'SPE' (although I believe that this can only be set as part of an OS X APP package, but in case another way...

 4) When a dialog is launched from the Palette, it is partially hidden behind the Palette. Also the preferences Palette. (spe_pref_part_hidden.pdf at the above location -- build in screen capture utility only goes to PDF, and don't have another utility setup right now.)

 5) cmd` &amp; cmd~ no longer write to the edit window, but also don't cycle through the windows. cmd (left arrow) doesn't go to the beginning of the line, cmd &lt;right arrow&gt; to the end of the line.

 6) On install, I delete the ~/.spe directory, the /site-packages _spe &amp; sm directories, yet when I do a File | Open in SPE, it remembers my last location. Handy, but shouldn't this pref be reset when I do the above?

 7) Under Links | Enthought... (<A HREF="http://www.enthought.com/python/">http://www.enthought.com/python/</A>) The main listed distro has a wxPython version too old for this version of SPE -- if the beta version linked at the bottom doesn't have a compatible wxPython, might want to remove the link....

 8) Help | Keyboard Shortcuts are Windows shortcuts....

 9) Minor Feature Request: would be nice to have an 'Open Recent' option on the File menu that remembers the last x (10?) files that you've opened.

10) In the UML view, if you have methods that have long names and/or many parameter, the class is much wider than the screen and the horizontal scrollbar doesn't scale correctly. (spe_uml.pdf) (Please, no comments on my code/design -- just playing around with my first Python app and tried to find something 'fun'.)

11) Pressing F1 doesn't bring up local help tips (as mentioned in the status bar at the bottom of SPE.)

12) When I have a file open (source code view), I need to double-click on a class/method in the Explorer view to jump to it -- as designed? (or should it be single click?)

13) When running from inside SPE, the scriptname isn't set.

Create the following in a new file. Save it.:

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    print &quot;hello&quot;

Run it:
Running '&lt;path/filename&gt;' ...
hello
Script '&lt;source&gt;' returned exit code 0

I assume that the above '&lt;source&gt;' should be the filename

14) If one creates a new file, doesn't save it, and tries to run it, if you say 'no' to save, the previously run file is run, not the selected new file. (not a recommended thing to do, of course, but....)

15) When my indenting was off by a character,  the error message was off by one line (running from the command line returned the correct line number (see message below -- it says 116, when run in command line, it is 115. (and not sure why it mentioned the 'scriptutils.py' file. (sorry if this is a PyCrust thing...)    

 Running '/Users/kkrull/work/learning/python/NWN/nwnCharacterCombatInfo.py' ...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/site-packages/sm/scriptutils.py&quot;, line 40, in run
    codeObject = compile(source.replace('\r\n','\n')+&quot;\n&quot;, fileName, &quot;exec&quot;)
IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level (&lt;source&gt;, line 116)
Exception raised while running script  &lt;source&gt;

 16) ctrl-c copies text in the SPE python shell, cmd-c expected on Mac (PyCrust run standalone recognizes cmd-c)

 17) In the python shell, one can type anywhere, new output from a run it put wherever the cursor is located. As expected? (when doing this, can delete/overwrite items, and undo doesn't undo changes.) Other shells (PyCrust stand alone) only allow text to be added on the last line. 


Sorry, I know I should do seperate bug reports, but time....

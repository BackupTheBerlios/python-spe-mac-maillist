<PRE>Hi,
BT means 'put on bug tracker' (if mac related, please choose that group).

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/python-spe-mac">jaguar451 at mac.com</A> wrote:

&gt;<i>A PDF of a screenshot at <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/kkrull/FileSharing6.html">http://homepage.mac.com/kkrull/FileSharing6.html</A> :
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If possible I prefer png or gif. Also when spe is stable. I need someone 
to take screenshots in a certain way for documentation. Any volunteers.

&gt;<i> 1) There are two 'Windows' menu items -- I assume that there should only be one.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'll fix that. Didn't wxPython on Mac would provide one. BT

&gt;<i> 2) On startup, I have 'Unnamed' &amp; 'Unnamed -- SPE 0.7.4.x' windows (see the SPE_windows_OS X.pdf file at the above URL.) If I set my preference to 'Single with tabs (Mac, Windows, Linux), when I open a second file, an additional window is opened, so I have three (untitled, untitled, SPE 0.7.4.x.) Single_with_tabs_not_single.pdf at above URL.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Did you restart SPE? After changing interface SPE would need to be 
restarted.

&gt;<i>    2.1) when I create new files, they all have the same name.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'll have a look at it, but maybe it's better like this.

&gt;<i>    2.2) As far as tabs being an OS X thing, I'm not a Mac head by any stretch of the imagination, and I like tab. Safari uses them... Other editors have them -- maybe time for a poll.... ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Haha, everybody wants something different. I indeed would like to poll 
tabs in these group. The option with no tabs will always be available, 
but with tabs will take me some more effort of which I want to save 
myself if nobody is waiting for it.

&gt;<i> 3) On menu, second from left, says 'Python' instead of 'SPE' (although I believe that this can only be set as part of an OS X APP package, but in case another way...
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That also struck me. If anybody knows how to change this, I'd be happy 
to implement.

&gt;<i> 4) When a dialog is launched from the Palette, it is partially hidden behind the Palette. Also the preferences Palette. (spe_pref_part_hidden.pdf at the above location -- build in screen capture utility only goes to PDF, and don't have another utility setup right now.)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This wxPy behaviour. I could hide the tools Palette when a dialog is 
launched and show it again when the dialog closes. Is that an option? BT

&gt;<i> 5) cmd` &amp; cmd~ no longer write to the edit window, but also don't cycle through the windows. cmd (left arrow) doesn't go to the beginning of the line, cmd &lt;right arrow&gt; to the end of the line.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This is on my todolist. Bug tracker.... call it mac keyboard shortcuts 
and be as complete as possible

&gt;<i> 6) On install, I delete the ~/.spe directory, the /site-packages _spe &amp; sm directories, yet when I do a File | Open in SPE, it remembers my last location. Handy, but shouldn't this pref be reset when I do the above?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This is handled by wxPy not SPE.

&gt;<i> 7) Under Links | Enthought... (<A HREF="http://www.enthought.com/python/">http://www.enthought.com/python/</A>) The main listed distro has a wxPython version too old for this version of SPE -- if the beta version linked at the bottom doesn't have a compatible wxPython, might want to remove the link....
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I know they are upgrading to wxPy2.6, but face some difficulties. I even 
could contact them to include SPE in their distro.

&gt;<i> 8) Help | Keyboard Shortcuts are Windows shortcuts....
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Right, low priority. Maybe one of you could fix this. Shouldn't be 
difficult. (in _spe/dialogs: helpShortcutsDialog.py and shortcuts.txt) 
Please keep it cross platform:
to check for mac:
if _spe.info.DARWIN:
    ...

&gt;<i> 9) Minor Feature Request: would be nice to have an 'Open Recent' option on the File menu that remembers the last x (10?) files that you've opened.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, I'll implement that. Put it in feature requests...

&gt;<i>10) In the UML view, if you have methods that have long names and/or many parameter, the class is much wider than the screen and the horizontal scrollbar doesn't scale correctly. (spe_uml.pdf) (Please, no comments on my code/design -- just playing around with my first Python app and tried to find something 'fun'.)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Put it in the bug tracker. In next releases I have some plans with UML.

&gt;<i>11) Pressing F1 doesn't bring up local help tips (as mentioned in the status bar at the bottom of SPE.)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Put also in bug tracker.

&gt;<i>12) When I have a file open (source code view), I need to double-click on a class/method in the Explorer view to jump to it -- as designed? (or should it be single click?)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Double-click is design.

&gt;<i>13) When running from inside SPE, the scriptname isn't set.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Create the following in a new file. Save it.:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i>    print &quot;hello&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Run it:
</I>&gt;<i>Running '&lt;path/filename&gt;' ...
</I>&gt;<i>hello
</I>&gt;<i>Script '&lt;source&gt;' returned exit code 0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I assume that the above '&lt;source&gt;' should be the filename
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Bug tracker...

&gt;<i>14) If one creates a new file, doesn't save it, and tries to run it, if you say 'no' to save, the previously run file is run, not the selected new file. (not a recommended thing to do, of course, but....)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>BT

&gt;<i>15) When my indenting was off by a character,  the error message was off by one line (running from the command line returned the correct line number (see message below -- it says 116, when run in command line, it is 115. (and not sure why it mentioned the 'scriptutils.py' file. (sorry if this is a PyCrust thing...)    
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Running '/Users/kkrull/work/learning/python/NWN/nwnCharacterCombatInfo.py' ...
</I>&gt;<i>Traceback (most recent call last):
</I>&gt;<i>  File &quot;/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/site-packages/sm/scriptutils.py&quot;, line 40, in run
</I>&gt;<i>    codeObject = compile(source.replace('\r\n','\n')+&quot;\n&quot;, fileName, &quot;exec&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level (&lt;source&gt;, line 116)
</I>&gt;<i>Exception raised while running script  &lt;source&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>BT

&gt;<i> 16) ctrl-c copies text in the SPE python shell, cmd-c expected on Mac (PyCrust run standalone recognizes cmd-c)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>BT, although I just use pycrust, but will have a look anyway.

&gt;<i> 17) In the python shell, one can type anywhere, new output from a run it put wherever the cursor is located. As expected? (when doing this, can delete/overwrite items, and undo doesn't undo changes.) Other shells (PyCrust stand alone) only allow text to be added on the last line. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>BT

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Sorry, I know I should do seperate bug reports, but time....
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I hope you find now some time for it. Thanks anyway for this usefull 
feedback. I wish I could get more feedback like this.

Stani

<PRE>Dear all,
The website is up again. Appearantly the screenshots went crazy, so I 
replaced it with a more simple page.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some of you contacted to warn me that my site is down. Thanks for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your concerns. Unfortunately the *.stani.be site drove the machine's 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> load up to 27 at the Zettai server. This made my site crash and I had 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to restart it frequently. For Zettai, who sponsors SPE in free 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hosting, this was alarming and they decided to shut down my site. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Altough I'm experienced with Python, I'm not that familiar with Zope. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyone who could help me monitoring what is wrong or even point me to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how I could solve the problem, would save my days.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm currently trying to convince Zettai to see if there is a way to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continue the SPE website. I have no reasons to complain about them, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the opposite: they always provided me with an excellent service, so I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can recommend them to anyone. Honnestly I think that their analysis 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that something is alarmlingly wrong is very justified.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The SPE website uses CoreBlog and I don't think that can be the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem. My personal portfolio site www.stani.be uses a lot of Python 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripting, but has low visitors. So in a way I would be surprised if 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's that. When the problem occurred, I installed cache managers, but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appearantly that didn't solve anything.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Recently I have put a lot of effort to develop SPE, especially 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concerning Mac Os X, new website and integrating the debugger. Of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> course this will postpone the release of SPE. The reason is that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first this will take me time and energy to see what is wrong and to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get it back online. The second reason is that the google ads 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> displayed on my page give me a very small income. I'm donating much 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of my freetime into this project and as donations are seldom and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> small, any extra income is welcome. It's at the moment the only way 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to generate some revenue with open source, as far as I know. This 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> income is mainly generated when there is a new release, so I feel it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is only reasonable as a developper not too lose that opportunity. A 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> company which would sponsor SPE is till now still a utopia, or not?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But if some zope expert could help me with solving this problem, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> please contact me. I hope Zettai will continue hosting SPE, otherwise 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'll have to look for another provider and than everything really 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gets delayed. Also soon I'll have three art shows simultaneously in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> France, Belgium and Germany, so than I have to be away for a while.

Yes, but that's better than the alternative, which is to end up with  
a vast,
unmanageable, and error-ridden core. For example, while I understand
Stani's desire for a Python editor that operates with Blender, that  
feature
should not be part of the core. If SPE becomes a widely used Python
editor, that (and any similarly specialized features) will simply not be
used by the general population, will add unnecessary complexity to
the interface, and will detract from improving and maintaining the core.

The flip side is that a plugin that is extremely useful to a large  
number
of people will probably be well-maintained, and quite possibly  
integrated
into the core. It's an evolutionary process.

As you can tell, I'm a big believer in simpler code. In virtually every
position I've worked in where I had to go into other people's old
code, I've started by ripping out large amount of useless or unnecessary
features, in some cases reducing by codebase by 80%. (I'm not saying
SPE falls into this category!) This was a particular problem at the
Human Genome Project. Once that was done, I could then get to
work on making genuine improvements to reliability and functionality.

&quot;Reliability and simplicity&quot; shouldn't be a mantra for software  
development,
it should be _the_ mantra. Until you've got that as a base, anything you
construct on top will be shaky and ultimate unusable.

Just had to get this rant off my chest, I do it periodically :-)

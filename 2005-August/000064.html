<PRE>Hi Ken and Stefano,
Thanks both for your donations! Finally a snow ball effect today? This 
brings the total amount of received donations up to 466 euro. More with 
the promised amount of Henning, this brings the total amount on 513 
euro. This means that now only 237 euro is missing. (All amounts are 
minus the Paypal fee, so it's really an advantage to pay through IBAN if 
you are in Europe.) Maybe this will stimulate other people as it's not 
unrealistic anymore. Feel free to choose yourself what it would be worth 
for you. It can be anything, but I'd recommend at least 10 euro. It's a 
pitty that no sponsering is available from Macintosh for this, as it is 
only in their benefit. I'll update the homepage, but now I'm just too 
busy with a deadline. However I couldn't wait to share this news.
So I hope to be able to develop SPE for you in september, if some more 
donations drop in. Probably than also I need someone who can give me a 
speed course about mac, eg how to upgrade wxPython, to make an app, etc...
Thanks a lot!
Stani

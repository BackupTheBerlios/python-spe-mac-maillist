Yeah -- I was more or less asking if there was a repository somewhere  
via which one can check out SPE and do 'svn update' to track your  
development.

Subversion is remarkably forgiving given that you can easily rename  
and/or move stuff around after the fact, unlike CVS.   For initial  
development, about all you need to know is 'svn add file' and 'svn  
commit file'.   I would encourage you to take a few minutes to pick  
it up if only such that the rest of us can track your work a bit more  
easily and, possibly/hopefully, contribute a patch or two. :-)

Let me know if you have any questions about Subversion -- I'd be  
happy to help.

</I>
OK.

If SPE uses the python distutils stuff, then py2app will happen  
automatically with a little tweaking here and there.  I think I can  
figure that part out assuming the underlying bits and pieces are  
fairly straightforward.

<PRE>+100 from me :-) think &quot;RISC&quot; also for software, furthermore composition
of pieces forces to do clean orthogonal concepts, if every evolution
depends on you, then you are the critical path or even the bottleneck of
a software project (I have my share on these experiences :-( , divide
and conquer pays off in software as well 
 
Just my 0.02$

	Yes, but that's better than the alternative, which is to end up
with a vast, 
	unmanageable, and error-ridden core. For example, while I
understand
	Stani's desire for a Python editor that operates with Blender,
that feature
	should not be part of the core. If SPE becomes a widely used
Python
	editor, that (and any similarly specialized features) will
simply not be
	used by the general population, will add unnecessary complexity
to
	the interface, and will detract from improving and maintaining
the core.

	The flip side is that a plugin that is extremely useful to a
large number
	of people will probably be well-maintained, and quite possibly
integrated
	into the core. It's an evolutionary process.

	As you can tell, I'm a big believer in simpler code. In
virtually every
	position I've worked in where I had to go into other people's
old
	code, I've started by ripping out large amount of useless or
unnecessary
	features, in some cases reducing by codebase by 80%. (I'm not
saying
	SPE falls into this category!) This was a particular problem at
the
	Human Genome Project. Once that was done, I could then get to
	work on making genuine improvements to reliability and
functionality.

	&quot;Reliability and simplicity&quot; shouldn't be a mantra for software
development,
	it should be _the_ mantra. Until you've got that as a base,
anything you
	construct on top will be shaky and ultimate unusable.

	Just had to get this rant off my chest, I do it periodically :-)

	Ken

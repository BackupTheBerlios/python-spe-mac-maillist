<PRE>Hi all,
Now I implemented all the document interfaces I wanted. Now it should be 
possible to run SPE on any platform how you prefer it single versus 
multiple document interface. So SPE can adapt itself as a kameleon. It 
would be nice if this would work smoothly, so let's get all the bugs out!

1) For the mac tab lovers, this is my own implementation for those who 
prefer a multiple document interface probably like safari. Please test 
if this file runs well on Mac (not other os):

    * Start the application and open with file&gt;new some child windows.
      Look when you close if some errors happen
    * Don't test it as an editor. The application on itself has no use.
    * Don't test shortcuts.
    * Send also screenshot of full desktop with Parent and some Child
      windows as png or gif
    * This test is not about the toolpalette

2) I REALLY need your help to solve the single document interface, which 
remained unsolved by lack of feedback. As I don't have a mac, I can't 
debug it and it should not be too difficult for you. I quote from my 
previous mail:

&gt;<i> Looking to the screenshot, I have the following questions:
</I>&gt;<i> - are there two parent windows (one with toolbar and one with tabs)?!
</I>&gt;<i> - it is weird that nothing happens when you click on the tabs, not 
</I>&gt;<i> even an error. Can you please execute this smdi.py (has only some more 
</I>&gt;<i> print statements) and send me the log file(debug.txt):
</I>&gt;<i> python spe.py --debug.txt&gt;debug.txt --&gt; I REALLY NEED THIS TO SEE WHY 
</I>&gt;<i> THE TABS ARE NOT WORKING!!!!!
</I>&gt;<i> - maybe some of you could plunge into the code and try to find out why 
</I>&gt;<i> a window is not raised: The windows should be raised by 
</I>&gt;<i> TabUnix.onFrameTab  which calls Tabs.raiseTab, which raises the actual 
</I>&gt;<i> MdiTabsChildFrame (of which the Raise method is overwritten by its 
</I>&gt;<i> Activate method). The bug should be obvious, which is a little bit 
</I>&gt;<i> frustrating, as I can not test it on a Mac. 
</I>
To switch between document interfaces 1 and 2 in smdi.py SPE comment and 
uncomment one of the last lines:
if __name__=='__main__':
    #__test__(debug=1,mdi=MDI_TABS_WIN)#single document interface for mac
    __test__(debug=1,mdi=MDI_SPLIT_ALL)#multiple document interface for mac

In general this smdi is more stable as the previous version, I removed 
some code which might provoque segmentation faults and the like.

Thanks,
Stani

I also would like to see SPE stable. However I believe that testing SPE 
on the Mac, will only increase its stability (rather than seeing it as a 
new feature), as wxMac seems to be more sensitive to mistakes. This 
gives in a way the advantage that errors are more fastly discovered. I 
noticed that with some sizer issues. I think if SPE runs well on Windows 
and Mac, probably it is true for all platforms.

The problems with donations till now, is that people start thinking 
about donating after the features they like are implemented. However 
donations are low. That's why I appreciate the donations for the Mac. 
For the first time users are donating to get something done, before it 
is implemented. This made me think I should start a bounty system, where 
I people could bid on features they would like to see implemented. It's 
not that I want to start earning money with SPE, but on the other hand 
it's also a pitty if things could work better if it is stimulated in 
another way. As you might now, developing a project like this asks a lot 
of time. For example a lot of users ask for a project manager, but would 
they be willing to pay for it? Also if SPE would give in some cash in 
one way or another, I could really spend more time on developping it,as 
it means I have to do less other jobs.

After I will have bought the Mac, I will do some serious bugfixing 
effort to make SPE stable on all platforms or as much as possible. (So 
the sooner I have the money for the Mac, hint, hint, ;-) ...) But of 
course I have the most fun by implementing some new cool features. Also 
I think of organising SPE maybe more like Firefox with downloadable 
extensions (which should also be easy for users to create), rather than 
a full suite which it is now.

These were just some thoughts,
Stani

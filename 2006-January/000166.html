<PRE>Hi Richard and Rudolph,

On 25 Jan 2006 09:09:39 EST, Richard E. Brown &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/python-spe-mac">Richard.E.Brown at dartware.com</A>&gt;

</I>

Rudolph can you confirm if the &quot;window updating&quot; is the one Richard
describes below or do you have other issues? If you work with large files,
it is better to set &quot;check realtime with&quot; to none in Preferences&gt;Editor if
typing would get slow.

I'm running SPE on a Rev.E Powerbook G4 (1.67Ghz) with 2GB of memory
&gt;<i> (OS X 10.4.4)
</I>

 Ha, I wished I had one of these ;-)

--- end of quote ---
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been waiting 'til we had a good version before mentioning this,
</I>

Please don't wait!

and I
&gt;<i> think it's a good time now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think there are two items here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1)      I've noticed that the scrolling in SPE was slow on my TiBook - to
</I>&gt;<i> the point
</I>&gt;<i> that it feels a little sluggish. I just tried 0.8.1.d on my Windows laptop
</I>&gt;<i> (similar speed) and it was pretty snappy.
</I>

Can you check if this is a wxPython issue, by copying&amp;pasting the same file
in the wxPython demo and see if it behaves the same. I wouldn't know what
would cause it too be slow. I'm afraid it is a wxMac issue.

I guess snappy is the opposite of sluggish? It might prove it is a wxMac
issue. Stefan, any thoughts about this?

2)      The newest SPE (SVN 149) had very peculiar window updating on my Mac
&gt;<i> (I
</I>&gt;<i> didn't try it on the Windows box).
</I>
The various panes would open very large, then
&gt;<i> shrink to their proper size each time a new file opened. Here's what I
</I>&gt;<i> saw:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -       On initial launch, the python terminal session openedin the full
</I>&gt;<i> window; then
</I>&gt;<i> shrunk down to the bottom third as normal.
</I>

The main window is a splitterwindow, it normally only updates its size at an
on Idle event. I forced it using the UpdateSize method and it seems to be
fixed now. (I'll update soon to the SVN.)

-       There's an error &quot;Error opening workspace file : No section:
&gt;<i> 'openfiles'&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> displayed there.
</I>

Fixed, now only displayed in statusbar if SPE is in debugging mode.

-       Opening a source file showed the entire source file filling the top
&gt;<i> pane (left
</I>&gt;<i> to right edges), then the split bar dividing the top pane, then a section
</I>&gt;<i> of a
</I>&gt;<i> file hierarchy in the left pane (don't know what that was)
</I>

The browser is back in town! It is the last tab of the sidebar. I strongly
recommend everyone to read the new SPE tutorial of Dimitri:
<A HREF="http://www.serpia.org/spe">http://www.serpia.org/spe</A> The browser is explained there.

Anyway, the browser before (wxPython 2.6.1 ) was buggy and was left out.
